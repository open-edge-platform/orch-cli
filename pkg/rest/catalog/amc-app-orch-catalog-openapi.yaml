      CatalogService provides API to manage the inventory of applications, deployment packages, and other resources related
       to deployment of applications at the network edge.

       The principal resources managed by the application catalog service are as follows:
       - [Application](catalog.v3.Application) represents a Helm\* chart that can be deployed to one or more Kubernetes\* pods.

       - [DeploymentPackage](catalog.v3.DeploymentPackage) represents a collection of applications (referenced by their name and a version) that are
          deployed together. The package can define one or more deployment profiles that specify the individual application
          profiles to be used when deploying each application. If applications need to be deployed in a particular order, the
          package can also define any startup dependencies between its constituent applications as a set of dependency graph edges.

       - [Registry](catalog.v3.Registry) represents a repository from which various artifacts, such as application Docker\* images or Helm charts,
          can be retrieved. As such, registry entity holds information used for finding and accessing the represented repository.

       - [Artifact](catalog.v3.Artifact) represents a binary artifact that can be used for various purposes, e.g. icon or thumbnail for UI display, or
          auxiliary artifacts for integration with various platform services such as Grafana\* dashboard and similar. An artifact may be
          used by multiple deployment packages.

       The API provides Create, Get, List, Update, Delete, and Watch operations for each of the above resources.

         empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request

             }

    google.protobuf.Timestamp:
      description: |-
        A Timestamp represents a point in time independent of any time zone or local
         calendar, encoded as a count of seconds and fractions of seconds at
         nanosecond resolution. The count is relative to an epoch at UTC midnight on
         January 1, 1970, in the proleptic Gregorian calendar which extends the
         Gregorian calendar backwards to year one.

         All minutes are 60 seconds long. Leap seconds are "smeared" so that no leap
         second table is needed for interpretation, using a [24-hour linear
         smear](https://developers.google.com/time/smear).

         The range is from 0001-01-01T00:00:00Z to 9999-12-31T23:59:59.999999999Z. By
         restricting to that range, we ensure that we can convert to and from [RFC
         3339](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt) date strings.

         # Examples

         Example 1: Compute Timestamp from POSIX `time()`.

             Timestamp timestamp;
             timestamp.set_seconds(time(NULL));
             timestamp.set_nanos(0);

         Example 2: Compute Timestamp from POSIX `gettimeofday()`.

             struct timeval tv;
             gettimeofday(&tv, NULL);

             Timestamp timestamp;
             timestamp.set_seconds(tv.tv_sec);
             timestamp.set_nanos(tv.tv_usec * 1000);

         Example 3: Compute Timestamp from Win32 `GetSystemTimeAsFileTime()`.

             FILETIME ft;
             GetSystemTimeAsFileTime(&ft);
             UINT64 ticks = (((UINT64)ft.dwHighDateTime) << 32) | ft.dwLowDateTime;

             // A Windows tick is 100 nanoseconds. Windows epoch 1601-01-01T00:00:00Z
             // is 11644473600 seconds before Unix epoch 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.
             Timestamp timestamp;
             timestamp.set_seconds((INT64) ((ticks / 10000000) - 11644473600LL));
             timestamp.set_nanos((INT32) ((ticks % 10000000) * 100));

         Example 4: Compute Timestamp from Java `System.currentTimeMillis()`.

             long millis = System.currentTimeMillis();

             Timestamp timestamp = Timestamp.newBuilder().setSeconds(millis / 1000)
                 .setNanos((int) ((millis % 1000) * 1000000)).build();

         Example 5: Compute Timestamp from Java `Instant.now()`.

             Instant now = Instant.now();

             Timestamp timestamp =
                 Timestamp.newBuilder().setSeconds(now.getEpochSecond())
                     .setNanos(now.getNano()).build();

         Example 6: Compute Timestamp from current time in Python.

             timestamp = Timestamp()
             timestamp.GetCurrentTime()

         # JSON Mapping

         In JSON format, the Timestamp type is encoded as a string in the
         [RFC 3339](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt) format. That is, the
         format is "{year}-{month}-{day}T{hour}:{min}:{sec}[.{frac_sec}]Z"
         where {year} is always expressed using four digits while {month}, {day},
         {hour}, {min}, and {sec} are zero-padded to two digits each. The fractional
         seconds, which can go up to 9 digits (i.e. up to 1 nanosecond resolution),
         are optional. The "Z" suffix indicates the timezone ("UTC"); the timezone
         is required. A proto3 JSON serializer should always use UTC (as indicated by
         "Z") when printing the Timestamp type and a proto3 JSON parser should be
         able to accept both UTC and other timezones (as indicated by an offset).

         For example, "2017-01-15T01:30:15.01Z" encodes 15.01 seconds past
         01:30 UTC on January 15, 2017.

         In JavaScript, one can convert a Date object to this format using the
         standard
         [toISOString()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toISOString)
         method. In Python, a standard `datetime.datetime` object can be converted
         to this format using
         [`strftime`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/time.html#time.strftime) with
         the time format spec '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ'. Likewise, in Java, one can use
         the Joda Time's [`ISODateTimeFormat.dateTime()`](
         http://joda-time.sourceforge.net/apidocs/org/joda/time/format/ISODateTimeFormat.html#dateTime()
         ) to obtain a formatter capable of generating timestamps in this format.
