              `FieldMask` represents a set of symbolic field paths, for example:

                   paths: "f.a"
                   paths: "f.b.d"

               Here `f` represents a field in some root message, `a` and `b`
               fields in the message found in `f`, and `d` a field found in the
               message in `f.b`.

               Field masks are used to specify a subset of fields that should be
               returned by a get operation or modified by an update operation.
               Field masks also have a custom JSON encoding (see below).

               # Field Masks in Projections

               When used in the context of a projection, a response message or
               sub-message is filtered by the API to only contain those fields as
               specified in the mask. For example, if the mask in the previous
               example is applied to a response message as follows:

                   f {
                     a : 22
                     b {
                       d : 1
                       x : 2
                     }
                     y : 13
                   }
                   z: 8

               The result will not contain specific values for fields x,y and z
               (their value will be set to the default, and omitted in proto text
               output):


                   f {
                     a : 22
                     b {
                       d : 1
                     }
                   }

               A repeated field is not allowed except at the last position of a
               paths string.

               If a FieldMask object is not present in a get operation, the
               operation applies to all fields (as if a FieldMask of all fields
               had been specified).

               Note that a field mask does not necessarily apply to the
               top-level response message. In case of a REST get operation, the
               field mask applies directly to the response, but in case of a REST
               list operation, the mask instead applies to each individual message
               in the returned resource list. In case of a REST custom method,
               other definitions may be used. Where the mask applies will be
               clearly documented together with its declaration in the API.  In
               any case, the effect on the returned resource/resources is required
               behavior for APIs.

               # Field Masks in Update Operations

               A field mask in update operations specifies which fields of the
               targeted resource are going to be updated. The API is required
               to only change the values of the fields as specified in the mask
               and leave the others untouched. If a resource is passed in to
               describe the updated values, the API ignores the values of all
               fields not covered by the mask.

               If a repeated field is specified for an update operation, new values will
               be appended to the existing repeated field in the target resource. Note that
               a repeated field is only allowed in the last position of a `paths` string.

               If a sub-message is specified in the last position of the field mask for an
               update operation, then new value will be merged into the existing sub-message
               in the target resource.

               For example, given the target message:

                   f {
                     b {
                       d: 1
                       x: 2
                     }
                     c: [1]
                   }

               And an update message:

                   f {
                     b {
                       d: 10
                     }
                     c: [2]
                   }

               then if the field mask is:

                paths: ["f.b", "f.c"]

               then the result will be:

                   f {
                     b {
                       d: 10
                       x: 2
                     }
                     c: [1, 2]
                   }

               An implementation may provide options to override this default behavior for
               repeated and message fields.

               In order to reset a field's value to the default, the field must
               be in the mask and set to the default value in the provided resource.
               Hence, in order to reset all fields of a resource, provide a default
               instance of the resource and set all fields in the mask, or do
               not provide a mask as described below.

               If a field mask is not present on update, the operation applies to
               all fields (as if a field mask of all fields has been specified).
               Note that in the presence of schema evolution, this may mean that
               fields the client does not know and has therefore not filled into
               the request will be reset to their default. If this is unwanted
               behavior, a specific service may require a client to always specify
               a field mask, producing an error if not.

               As with get operations, the location of the resource which
               describes the updated values in the request message depends on the
               operation kind. In any case, the effect of the field mask is
               required to be honored by the API.

               ## Considerations for HTTP REST

               The HTTP kind of an update operation which uses a field mask must
               be set to PATCH instead of PUT in order to satisfy HTTP semantics
               (PUT must only be used for full updates).

               # JSON Encoding of Field Masks

               In JSON, a field mask is encoded as a single string where paths are
               separated by a comma. Fields name in each path are converted
               to/from lower-camel naming conventions.

               As an example, consider the following message declarations:

                   message Profile {
                     User user = 1;
                     Photo photo = 2;
                   }
                   message User {
                     string display_name = 1;
                     string address = 2;
                   }

               In proto a field mask for `Profile` may look as such:

                   mask {
                     paths: "user.display_name"
                     paths: "photo"
                   }

               In JSON, the same mask is represented as below:

                   {
                     mask: "user.displayName,photo"
                   }

               # Field Masks and Oneof Fields

               Field masks treat fields in oneofs just as regular fields. Consider the
               following message:

                   message SampleMessage {
                     oneof test_oneof {
                       string name = 4;
                       SubMessage sub_message = 9;
                     }
                   }

               The field mask can be:

                   mask {
                     paths: "name"
                   }

               Or:

                   mask {
                     paths: "sub_message"
                   }

               Note that oneof type names ("test_oneof" in this case) cannot be used in
               paths.

               ## Field Mask Verification

               The implementation of any API method which has a FieldMask type field in the
               request should verify the included field paths, and return an
               `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error if any path is unmappable.

              `FieldMask` represents a set of symbolic field paths, for example:

                   paths: "f.a"
                   paths: "f.b.d"

               Here `f` represents a field in some root message, `a` and `b`
               fields in the message found in `f`, and `d` a field found in the
               message in `f.b`.

               Field masks are used to specify a subset of fields that should be
               returned by a get operation or modified by an update operation.
               Field masks also have a custom JSON encoding (see below).

               # Field Masks in Projections

               When used in the context of a projection, a response message or
               sub-message is filtered by the API to only contain those fields as
               specified in the mask. For example, if the mask in the previous
               example is applied to a response message as follows:

                   f {
                     a : 22
                     b {
                       d : 1
                       x : 2
                     }
                     y : 13
                   }
                   z: 8

               The result will not contain specific values for fields x,y and z
               (their value will be set to the default, and omitted in proto text
               output):


                   f {
                     a : 22
                     b {
                       d : 1
                     }
                   }

               A repeated field is not allowed except at the last position of a
               paths string.

               If a FieldMask object is not present in a get operation, the
               operation applies to all fields (as if a FieldMask of all fields
               had been specified).

               Note that a field mask does not necessarily apply to the
               top-level response message. In case of a REST get operation, the
               field mask applies directly to the response, but in case of a REST
               list operation, the mask instead applies to each individual message
               in the returned resource list. In case of a REST custom method,
               other definitions may be used. Where the mask applies will be
               clearly documented together with its declaration in the API.  In
               any case, the effect on the returned resource/resources is required
               behavior for APIs.

               # Field Masks in Update Operations

               A field mask in update operations specifies which fields of the
               targeted resource are going to be updated. The API is required
               to only change the values of the fields as specified in the mask
               and leave the others untouched. If a resource is passed in to
               describe the updated values, the API ignores the values of all
               fields not covered by the mask.

               If a repeated field is specified for an update operation, new values will
               be appended to the existing repeated field in the target resource. Note that
               a repeated field is only allowed in the last position of a `paths` string.

               If a sub-message is specified in the last position of the field mask for an
               update operation, then new value will be merged into the existing sub-message
               in the target resource.

               For example, given the target message:

                   f {
                     b {
                       d: 1
                       x: 2
                     }
                     c: [1]
                   }

               And an update message:

                   f {
                     b {
                       d: 10
                     }
                     c: [2]
                   }

               then if the field mask is:

                paths: ["f.b", "f.c"]

               then the result will be:

                   f {
                     b {
                       d: 10
                       x: 2
                     }
                     c: [1, 2]
                   }

               An implementation may provide options to override this default behavior for
               repeated and message fields.

               In order to reset a field's value to the default, the field must
               be in the mask and set to the default value in the provided resource.
               Hence, in order to reset all fields of a resource, provide a default
               instance of the resource and set all fields in the mask, or do
               not provide a mask as described below.

               If a field mask is not present on update, the operation applies to
               all fields (as if a field mask of all fields has been specified).
               Note that in the presence of schema evolution, this may mean that
               fields the client does not know and has therefore not filled into
               the request will be reset to their default. If this is unwanted
               behavior, a specific service may require a client to always specify
               a field mask, producing an error if not.

               As with get operations, the location of the resource which
               describes the updated values in the request message depends on the
               operation kind. In any case, the effect of the field mask is
               required to be honored by the API.

               ## Considerations for HTTP REST

               The HTTP kind of an update operation which uses a field mask must
               be set to PATCH instead of PUT in order to satisfy HTTP semantics
               (PUT must only be used for full updates).

               # JSON Encoding of Field Masks

               In JSON, a field mask is encoded as a single string where paths are
               separated by a comma. Fields name in each path are converted
               to/from lower-camel naming conventions.

               As an example, consider the following message declarations:

                   message Profile {
                     User user = 1;
                     Photo photo = 2;
                   }
                   message User {
                     string display_name = 1;
                     string address = 2;
                   }

               In proto a field mask for `Profile` may look as such:

                   mask {
                     paths: "user.display_name"
                     paths: "photo"
                   }

               In JSON, the same mask is represented as below:

                   {
                     mask: "user.displayName,photo"
                   }

               # Field Masks and Oneof Fields

               Field masks treat fields in oneofs just as regular fields. Consider the
               following message:

                   message SampleMessage {
                     oneof test_oneof {
                       string name = 4;
                       SubMessage sub_message = 9;
                     }
                   }

               The field mask can be:

                   mask {
                     paths: "name"
                   }

               Or:

                   mask {
                     paths: "sub_message"
                   }

               Note that oneof type names ("test_oneof" in this case) cannot be used in
               paths.

               ## Field Mask Verification

               The implementation of any API method which has a FieldMask type field in the
               request should verify the included field paths, and return an
               `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error if any path is unmappable.

              `FieldMask` represents a set of symbolic field paths, for example:

                   paths: "f.a"
                   paths: "f.b.d"

               Here `f` represents a field in some root message, `a` and `b`
               fields in the message found in `f`, and `d` a field found in the
               message in `f.b`.

               Field masks are used to specify a subset of fields that should be
               returned by a get operation or modified by an update operation.
               Field masks also have a custom JSON encoding (see below).

               # Field Masks in Projections

               When used in the context of a projection, a response message or
               sub-message is filtered by the API to only contain those fields as
               specified in the mask. For example, if the mask in the previous
               example is applied to a response message as follows:

                   f {
                     a : 22
                     b {
                       d : 1
                       x : 2
                     }
                     y : 13
                   }
                   z: 8

               The result will not contain specific values for fields x,y and z
               (their value will be set to the default, and omitted in proto text
               output):


                   f {
                     a : 22
                     b {
                       d : 1
                     }
                   }

               A repeated field is not allowed except at the last position of a
               paths string.

               If a FieldMask object is not present in a get operation, the
               operation applies to all fields (as if a FieldMask of all fields
               had been specified).

               Note that a field mask does not necessarily apply to the
               top-level response message. In case of a REST get operation, the
               field mask applies directly to the response, but in case of a REST
               list operation, the mask instead applies to each individual message
               in the returned resource list. In case of a REST custom method,
               other definitions may be used. Where the mask applies will be
               clearly documented together with its declaration in the API.  In
               any case, the effect on the returned resource/resources is required
               behavior for APIs.

               # Field Masks in Update Operations

               A field mask in update operations specifies which fields of the
               targeted resource are going to be updated. The API is required
               to only change the values of the fields as specified in the mask
               and leave the others untouched. If a resource is passed in to
               describe the updated values, the API ignores the values of all
               fields not covered by the mask.

               If a repeated field is specified for an update operation, new values will
               be appended to the existing repeated field in the target resource. Note that
               a repeated field is only allowed in the last position of a `paths` string.

               If a sub-message is specified in the last position of the field mask for an
               update operation, then new value will be merged into the existing sub-message
               in the target resource.

               For example, given the target message:

                   f {
                     b {
                       d: 1
                       x: 2
                     }
                     c: [1]
                   }

               And an update message:

                   f {
                     b {
                       d: 10
                     }
                     c: [2]
                   }

               then if the field mask is:

                paths: ["f.b", "f.c"]

               then the result will be:

                   f {
                     b {
                       d: 10
                       x: 2
                     }
                     c: [1, 2]
                   }

               An implementation may provide options to override this default behavior for
               repeated and message fields.

               In order to reset a field's value to the default, the field must
               be in the mask and set to the default value in the provided resource.
               Hence, in order to reset all fields of a resource, provide a default
               instance of the resource and set all fields in the mask, or do
               not provide a mask as described below.

               If a field mask is not present on update, the operation applies to
               all fields (as if a field mask of all fields has been specified).
               Note that in the presence of schema evolution, this may mean that
               fields the client does not know and has therefore not filled into
               the request will be reset to their default. If this is unwanted
               behavior, a specific service may require a client to always specify
               a field mask, producing an error if not.

               As with get operations, the location of the resource which
               describes the updated values in the request message depends on the
               operation kind. In any case, the effect of the field mask is
               required to be honored by the API.

               ## Considerations for HTTP REST

               The HTTP kind of an update operation which uses a field mask must

               # JSON Encoding of Field Masks

               In JSON, a field mask is encoded as a single string where paths are
               separated by a comma. Fields name in each path are converted
               to/from lower-camel naming conventions.

               As an example, consider the following message declarations:

                   message Profile {
                     User user = 1;
                     Photo photo = 2;
                   }
                   message User {
                     string display_name = 1;
                     string address = 2;
                   }

               In proto a field mask for `Profile` may look as such:

                   mask {
                     paths: "user.display_name"
                     paths: "photo"
                   }

               In JSON, the same mask is represented as below:

                   {
                     mask: "user.displayName,photo"
                   }

               # Field Masks and Oneof Fields

               Field masks treat fields in oneofs just as regular fields. Consider the
               following message:

                   message SampleMessage {
                     oneof test_oneof {
                       string name = 4;
                       SubMessage sub_message = 9;
                     }
                   }

               The field mask can be:

                   mask {
                     paths: "name"
                   }

               Or:

                   mask {
                     paths: "sub_message"
                   }

               Note that oneof type names ("test_oneof" in this case) cannot be used in
               paths.

               ## Field Mask Verification

               The implementation of any API method which has a FieldMask type field in the
               request should verify the included field paths, and return an
               `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error if any path is unmappable.

              `FieldMask` represents a set of symbolic field paths, for example:

                   paths: "f.a"
                   paths: "f.b.d"

               Here `f` represents a field in some root message, `a` and `b`
               fields in the message found in `f`, and `d` a field found in the
               message in `f.b`.

               Field masks are used to specify a subset of fields that should be
               returned by a get operation or modified by an update operation.
               Field masks also have a custom JSON encoding (see below).

               # Field Masks in Projections

               When used in the context of a projection, a response message or
               sub-message is filtered by the API to only contain those fields as
               specified in the mask. For example, if the mask in the previous
               example is applied to a response message as follows:

                   f {
                     a : 22
                     b {
                       d : 1
                       x : 2
                     }
                     y : 13
                   }
                   z: 8

               The result will not contain specific values for fields x,y and z
               (their value will be set to the default, and omitted in proto text
               output):


                   f {
                     a : 22
                     b {
                       d : 1
                     }
                   }

               A repeated field is not allowed except at the last position of a
               paths string.

               If a FieldMask object is not present in a get operation, the
               operation applies to all fields (as if a FieldMask of all fields
               had been specified).

               Note that a field mask does not necessarily apply to the
               top-level response message. In case of a REST get operation, the
               field mask applies directly to the response, but in case of a REST
               list operation, the mask instead applies to each individual message
               in the returned resource list. In case of a REST custom method,
               other definitions may be used. Where the mask applies will be
               clearly documented together with its declaration in the API.  In
               any case, the effect on the returned resource/resources is required
               behavior for APIs.

               # Field Masks in Update Operations

               A field mask in update operations specifies which fields of the
               targeted resource are going to be updated. The API is required
               to only change the values of the fields as specified in the mask
               and leave the others untouched. If a resource is passed in to
               describe the updated values, the API ignores the values of all
               fields not covered by the mask.

               If a repeated field is specified for an update operation, new values will
               be appended to the existing repeated field in the target resource. Note that
               a repeated field is only allowed in the last position of a `paths` string.

               If a sub-message is specified in the last position of the field mask for an
               update operation, then new value will be merged into the existing sub-message
               in the target resource.

               For example, given the target message:

                   f {
                     b {
                       d: 1
                       x: 2
                     }
                     c: [1]
                   }

               And an update message:

                   f {
                     b {
                       d: 10
                     }
                     c: [2]
                   }

               then if the field mask is:

                paths: ["f.b", "f.c"]

               then the result will be:

                   f {
                     b {
                       d: 10
                       x: 2
                     }
                     c: [1, 2]
                   }

               An implementation may provide options to override this default behavior for
               repeated and message fields.

               In order to reset a field's value to the default, the field must
               be in the mask and set to the default value in the provided resource.
               Hence, in order to reset all fields of a resource, provide a default
               instance of the resource and set all fields in the mask, or do
               not provide a mask as described below.

               If a field mask is not present on update, the operation applies to
               all fields (as if a field mask of all fields has been specified).
               Note that in the presence of schema evolution, this may mean that
               fields the client does not know and has therefore not filled into
               the request will be reset to their default. If this is unwanted
               behavior, a specific service may require a client to always specify
               a field mask, producing an error if not.

               As with get operations, the location of the resource which
               describes the updated values in the request message depends on the
               operation kind. In any case, the effect of the field mask is
               required to be honored by the API.

               ## Considerations for HTTP REST

               The HTTP kind of an update operation which uses a field mask must
               be set to PATCH instead of PUT in order to satisfy HTTP semantics
               (PUT must only be used for full updates).

               # JSON Encoding of Field Masks

               In JSON, a field mask is encoded as a single string where paths are
               separated by a comma. Fields name in each path are converted
               to/from lower-camel naming conventions.

               As an example, consider the following message declarations:

                   message Profile {
                     User user = 1;
                     Photo photo = 2;
                   }
                   message User {
                     string display_name = 1;
                     string address = 2;
                   }

               In proto a field mask for `Profile` may look as such:

                   mask {
                     paths: "user.display_name"
                     paths: "photo"
                   }

               In JSON, the same mask is represented as below:

                   {
                     mask: "user.displayName,photo"
                   }

               # Field Masks and Oneof Fields

               Field masks treat fields in oneofs just as regular fields. Consider the
               following message:

                   message SampleMessage {
                     oneof test_oneof {
                       string name = 4;
                       SubMessage sub_message = 9;
                     }
                   }

               The field mask can be:

                   mask {
                     paths: "name"
                   }

               Or:

                   mask {
                     paths: "sub_message"
                   }

               Note that oneof type names ("test_oneof" in this case) cannot be used in
               paths.

               ## Field Mask Verification

               The implementation of any API method which has a FieldMask type field in the
               request should verify the included field paths, and return an
               `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error if any path is unmappable.

              `FieldMask` represents a set of symbolic field paths, for example:

                   paths: "f.a"
                   paths: "f.b.d"

               Here `f` represents a field in some root message, `a` and `b`
               fields in the message found in `f`, and `d` a field found in the
               message in `f.b`.

               Field masks are used to specify a subset of fields that should be
               returned by a get operation or modified by an update operation.
               Field masks also have a custom JSON encoding (see below).

               # Field Masks in Projections

               When used in the context of a projection, a response message or
               sub-message is filtered by the API to only contain those fields as
               specified in the mask. For example, if the mask in the previous
               example is applied to a response message as follows:

                   f {
                     a : 22
                     b {
                       d : 1
                       x : 2
                     }
                     y : 13
                   }
                   z: 8

               The result will not contain specific values for fields x,y and z
               (their value will be set to the default, and omitted in proto text
               output):


                   f {

                       d : 1
                     }
                   }

               A repeated field is not allowed except at the last position of a
               paths string.

               If a FieldMask object is not present in a get operation, the
               operation applies to all fields (as if a FieldMask of all fields
               had been specified).

               Note that a field mask does not necessarily apply to the
               top-level response message. In case of a REST get operation, the
               field mask applies directly to the response, but in case of a REST
               list operation, the mask instead applies to each individual message
               in the returned resource list. In case of a REST custom method,
               other definitions may be used. Where the mask applies will be
               clearly documented together with its declaration in the API.  In
               any case, the effect on the returned resource/resources is required
               behavior for APIs.

               # Field Masks in Update Operations

               A field mask in update operations specifies which fields of the
               targeted resource are going to be updated. The API is required
               to only change the values of the fields as specified in the mask
               and leave the others untouched. If a resource is passed in to
               describe the updated values, the API ignores the values of all
               fields not covered by the mask.

               If a repeated field is specified for an update operation, new values will
               be appended to the existing repeated field in the target resource. Note that
               a repeated field is only allowed in the last position of a `paths` string.

               If a sub-message is specified in the last position of the field mask for an
               update operation, then new value will be merged into the existing sub-message
               in the target resource.

               For example, given the target message:

                   f {
                     b {
                       d: 1
                       x: 2
                     }
                     c: [1]
                   }

               And an update message:

                   f {
                     b {
                       d: 10
                     }
                     c: [2]
                   }

               then if the field mask is:

                paths: ["f.b", "f.c"]

               then the result will be:

                   f {
                     b {
                       d: 10
                       x: 2
                     }
                     c: [1, 2]
                   }

               An implementation may provide options to override this default behavior for
               repeated and message fields.

               In order to reset a field's value to the default, the field must
               be in the mask and set to the default value in the provided resource.
               Hence, in order to reset all fields of a resource, provide a default
               instance of the resource and set all fields in the mask, or do
               not provide a mask as described below.

               If a field mask is not present on update, the operation applies to
               all fields (as if a field mask of all fields has been specified).
               Note that in the presence of schema evolution, this may mean that
               fields the client does not know and has therefore not filled into
               the request will be reset to their default. If this is unwanted
               behavior, a specific service may require a client to always specify
               a field mask, producing an error if not.

               As with get operations, the location of the resource which
               describes the updated values in the request message depends on the
               operation kind. In any case, the effect of the field mask is
               required to be honored by the API.

               ## Considerations for HTTP REST

               The HTTP kind of an update operation which uses a field mask must
               be set to PATCH instead of PUT in order to satisfy HTTP semantics
               (PUT must only be used for full updates).

               # JSON Encoding of Field Masks

               In JSON, a field mask is encoded as a single string where paths are
               separated by a comma. Fields name in each path are converted
               to/from lower-camel naming conventions.

               As an example, consider the following message declarations:

                   message Profile {
                     User user = 1;
                     Photo photo = 2;
                   }
                   message User {
                     string display_name = 1;
                     string address = 2;
                   }

               In proto a field mask for `Profile` may look as such:

                   mask {
                     paths: "user.display_name"
                     paths: "photo"
                   }

               In JSON, the same mask is represented as below:

                   {
                     mask: "user.displayName,photo"
                   }

               # Field Masks and Oneof Fields

               Field masks treat fields in oneofs just as regular fields. Consider the
               following message:

                   message SampleMessage {
                     oneof test_oneof {
                       string name = 4;
                       SubMessage sub_message = 9;
                     }
                   }

               The field mask can be:

                   mask {
                     paths: "name"
                   }

               Or:

                   mask {
                     paths: "sub_message"
                   }

               Note that oneof type names ("test_oneof" in this case) cannot be used in
               paths.

               ## Field Mask Verification

               The implementation of any API method which has a FieldMask type field in the
               request should verify the included field paths, and return an
               `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error if any path is unmappable.

               fields in the message found in `f`, and `d` a field found in the
               message in `f.b`.

               Field masks are used to specify a subset of fields that should be
               returned by a get operation or modified by an update operation.
               Field masks also have a custom JSON encoding (see below).

               # Field Masks in Projections

               When used in the context of a projection, a response message or
               sub-message is filtered by the API to only contain those fields as
               specified in the mask. For example, if the mask in the previous
               example is applied to a response message as follows:

                   f {
                     a : 22
                     b {
                       d : 1
                       x : 2
                     }
                     y : 13
                   }
                   z: 8

               The result will not contain specific values for fields x,y and z
               (their value will be set to the default, and omitted in proto text
               output):


                   f {
                     a : 22
                     b {
                       d : 1
                     }
                   }

               A repeated field is not allowed except at the last position of a
               paths string.

               If a FieldMask object is not present in a get operation, the
               operation applies to all fields (as if a FieldMask of all fields
               had been specified).

               Note that a field mask does not necessarily apply to the
               top-level response message. In case of a REST get operation, the
               field mask applies directly to the response, but in case of a REST
               list operation, the mask instead applies to each individual message
               in the returned resource list. In case of a REST custom method,
               other definitions may be used. Where the mask applies will be
               clearly documented together with its declaration in the API.  In
               any case, the effect on the returned resource/resources is required
               behavior for APIs.

               # Field Masks in Update Operations

               A field mask in update operations specifies which fields of the
               targeted resource are going to be updated. The API is required
               to only change the values of the fields as specified in the mask
               and leave the others untouched. If a resource is passed in to
               describe the updated values, the API ignores the values of all
               fields not covered by the mask.

               If a repeated field is specified for an update operation, new values will
               be appended to the existing repeated field in the target resource. Note that
               a repeated field is only allowed in the last position of a `paths` string.

               If a sub-message is specified in the last position of the field mask for an
               update operation, then new value will be merged into the existing sub-message
               in the target resource.

               For example, given the target message:

                   f {
                     b {
                       d: 1
                       x: 2
                     }
                     c: [1]
                   }

               And an update message:

                   f {
                     b {
                       d: 10
                     }
                     c: [2]
                   }

               then if the field mask is:

                paths: ["f.b", "f.c"]

               then the result will be:

                   f {
                     b {
                       d: 10
                       x: 2
                     }
                     c: [1, 2]
                   }

               An implementation may provide options to override this default behavior for
               repeated and message fields.

               In order to reset a field's value to the default, the field must
               be in the mask and set to the default value in the provided resource.
               Hence, in order to reset all fields of a resource, provide a default
               instance of the resource and set all fields in the mask, or do
               not provide a mask as described below.

               If a field mask is not present on update, the operation applies to
               all fields (as if a field mask of all fields has been specified).
               Note that in the presence of schema evolution, this may mean that
               fields the client does not know and has therefore not filled into
               the request will be reset to their default. If this is unwanted
               behavior, a specific service may require a client to always specify
               a field mask, producing an error if not.

               As with get operations, the location of the resource which
               describes the updated values in the request message depends on the
               operation kind. In any case, the effect of the field mask is
               required to be honored by the API.

               ## Considerations for HTTP REST

               The HTTP kind of an update operation which uses a field mask must
               be set to PATCH instead of PUT in order to satisfy HTTP semantics
               (PUT must only be used for full updates).

               # JSON Encoding of Field Masks

               In JSON, a field mask is encoded as a single string where paths are
               separated by a comma. Fields name in each path are converted
               to/from lower-camel naming conventions.

               As an example, consider the following message declarations:

                   message Profile {
                     User user = 1;
                     Photo photo = 2;
                   }
                   message User {
                     string display_name = 1;
                     string address = 2;
                   }

               In proto a field mask for `Profile` may look as such:

                   mask {
                     paths: "user.display_name"
                     paths: "photo"
                   }

               In JSON, the same mask is represented as below:

                   {
                     mask: "user.displayName,photo"
                   }

               # Field Masks and Oneof Fields

               Field masks treat fields in oneofs just as regular fields. Consider the
               following message:

                   message SampleMessage {
                     oneof test_oneof {
                       string name = 4;
                       SubMessage sub_message = 9;
                     }
                   }

               The field mask can be:

                   mask {
                     paths: "name"
                   }

               Or:

                   mask {
                     paths: "sub_message"
                   }

               Note that oneof type names ("test_oneof" in this case) cannot be used in
               paths.

               ## Field Mask Verification

               The implementation of any API method which has a FieldMask type field in the
               request should verify the included field paths, and return an
               `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error if any path is unmappable.

              `FieldMask` represents a set of symbolic field paths, for example:

                   paths: "f.a"
                   paths: "f.b.d"

               Here `f` represents a field in some root message, `a` and `b`
               fields in the message found in `f`, and `d` a field found in the
               message in `f.b`.

               Field masks are used to specify a subset of fields that should be
               returned by a get operation or modified by an update operation.
               Field masks also have a custom JSON encoding (see below).

               # Field Masks in Projections

               When used in the context of a projection, a response message or
               sub-message is filtered by the API to only contain those fields as
               specified in the mask. For example, if the mask in the previous
               example is applied to a response message as follows:

                   f {
                     a : 22
                     b {
                       d : 1
                       x : 2
                     }
                     y : 13
                   }
                   z: 8

               The result will not contain specific values for fields x,y and z
               (their value will be set to the default, and omitted in proto text
               output):


                   f {
                     a : 22
                     b {
                       d : 1
                     }
                   }

               A repeated field is not allowed except at the last position of a
               paths string.

               If a FieldMask object is not present in a get operation, the
               operation applies to all fields (as if a FieldMask of all fields
               had been specified).

               Note that a field mask does not necessarily apply to the
               top-level response message. In case of a REST get operation, the
               field mask applies directly to the response, but in case of a REST
               list operation, the mask instead applies to each individual message
               in the returned resource list. In case of a REST custom method,
               other definitions may be used. Where the mask applies will be
               clearly documented together with its declaration in the API.  In
               any case, the effect on the returned resource/resources is required
               behavior for APIs.

               # Field Masks in Update Operations

               A field mask in update operations specifies which fields of the
               targeted resource are going to be updated. The API is required
               to only change the values of the fields as specified in the mask
               and leave the others untouched. If a resource is passed in to
               describe the updated values, the API ignores the values of all
               fields not covered by the mask.

               If a repeated field is specified for an update operation, new values will
               be appended to the existing repeated field in the target resource. Note that
               a repeated field is only allowed in the last position of a `paths` string.

               If a sub-message is specified in the last position of the field mask for an
               update operation, then new value will be merged into the existing sub-message
               in the target resource.

               For example, given the target message:

                   f {
                     b {
                       d: 1
                       x: 2
                     }
                     c: [1]
                   }

               And an update message:

                   f {
                     b {
                       d: 10
                     }
                     c: [2]
                   }

               then if the field mask is:

                paths: ["f.b", "f.c"]

               then the result will be:

                   f {
                     b {
                       d: 10
                       x: 2
                     }
                     c: [1, 2]
                   }

               An implementation may provide options to override this default behavior for
               repeated and message fields.

               In order to reset a field's value to the default, the field must
               be in the mask and set to the default value in the provided resource.
               Hence, in order to reset all fields of a resource, provide a default
               instance of the resource and set all fields in the mask, or do
               not provide a mask as described below.

               If a field mask is not present on update, the operation applies to
               all fields (as if a field mask of all fields has been specified).
               Note that in the presence of schema evolution, this may mean that
               fields the client does not know and has therefore not filled into
               the request will be reset to their default. If this is unwanted
               behavior, a specific service may require a client to always specify
               a field mask, producing an error if not.

               As with get operations, the location of the resource which
               describes the updated values in the request message depends on the
               operation kind. In any case, the effect of the field mask is
               required to be honored by the API.

               ## Considerations for HTTP REST

               The HTTP kind of an update operation which uses a field mask must
               be set to PATCH instead of PUT in order to satisfy HTTP semantics
               (PUT must only be used for full updates).

               # JSON Encoding of Field Masks

               In JSON, a field mask is encoded as a single string where paths are
               separated by a comma. Fields name in each path are converted
               to/from lower-camel naming conventions.

               As an example, consider the following message declarations:

                   message Profile {
                     User user = 1;
                     Photo photo = 2;
                   }
                   message User {
                     string display_name = 1;
                     string address = 2;
                   }

               In proto a field mask for `Profile` may look as such:

                   mask {
                     paths: "user.display_name"
                     paths: "photo"
                   }

               In JSON, the same mask is represented as below:

                   {
                     mask: "user.displayName,photo"
                   }

               # Field Masks and Oneof Fields

               Field masks treat fields in oneofs just as regular fields. Consider the
               following message:

                   message SampleMessage {
                     oneof test_oneof {
                       string name = 4;
                       SubMessage sub_message = 9;
                     }
                   }

               The field mask can be:

                   mask {
                     paths: "name"
                   }

               Or:

                   mask {
                     paths: "sub_message"
                   }

               Note that oneof type names ("test_oneof" in this case) cannot be used in
               paths.

               ## Field Mask Verification

               The implementation of any API method which has a FieldMask type field in the
               request should verify the included field paths, and return an
               `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error if any path is unmappable.

              `FieldMask` represents a set of symbolic field paths, for example:

                   paths: "f.a"
                   paths: "f.b.d"

               Here `f` represents a field in some root message, `a` and `b`
               fields in the message found in `f`, and `d` a field found in the
               message in `f.b`.

               Field masks are used to specify a subset of fields that should be
               returned by a get operation or modified by an update operation.
               Field masks also have a custom JSON encoding (see below).

               # Field Masks in Projections

               When used in the context of a projection, a response message or
               sub-message is filtered by the API to only contain those fields as
               specified in the mask. For example, if the mask in the previous
               example is applied to a response message as follows:

                   f {
                     a : 22
                     b {
                       d : 1
                       x : 2
                     }
                     y : 13
                   }
                   z: 8

               The result will not contain specific values for fields x,y and z
               (their value will be set to the default, and omitted in proto text
               output):


                   f {
                     a : 22
                     b {
                       d : 1
                     }
                   }

               A repeated field is not allowed except at the last position of a
               paths string.

               If a FieldMask object is not present in a get operation, the
               operation applies to all fields (as if a FieldMask of all fields
               had been specified).

               Note that a field mask does not necessarily apply to the
               top-level response message. In case of a REST get operation, the
               field mask applies directly to the response, but in case of a REST
               list operation, the mask instead applies to each individual message
               in the returned resource list. In case of a REST custom method,
               other definitions may be used. Where the mask applies will be
               clearly documented together with its declaration in the API.  In
               any case, the effect on the returned resource/resources is required
               behavior for APIs.

               # Field Masks in Update Operations

               A field mask in update operations specifies which fields of the
               targeted resource are going to be updated. The API is required
               to only change the values of the fields as specified in the mask
               and leave the others untouched. If a resource is passed in to
               describe the updated values, the API ignores the values of all
               fields not covered by the mask.

               If a repeated field is specified for an update operation, new values will
               be appended to the existing repeated field in the target resource. Note that
               a repeated field is only allowed in the last position of a `paths` string.

               If a sub-message is specified in the last position of the field mask for an
               update operation, then new value will be merged into the existing sub-message
               in the target resource.

               For example, given the target message:

                   f {
                     b {
                       d: 1
                       x: 2
                     }
                     c: [1]
                   }

               And an update message:

                   f {
                     b {
                       d: 10
                     }
                     c: [2]
                   }

               then if the field mask is:

                paths: ["f.b", "f.c"]

               then the result will be:

                   f {
                     b {
                       d: 10
                       x: 2
                     }
                     c: [1, 2]
                   }

               An implementation may provide options to override this default behavior for
               repeated and message fields.

               In order to reset a field's value to the default, the field must
               be in the mask and set to the default value in the provided resource.
               Hence, in order to reset all fields of a resource, provide a default
               instance of the resource and set all fields in the mask, or do
               not provide a mask as described below.

               If a field mask is not present on update, the operation applies to
               all fields (as if a field mask of all fields has been specified).
               Note that in the presence of schema evolution, this may mean that
               fields the client does not know and has therefore not filled into
               the request will be reset to their default. If this is unwanted
               behavior, a specific service may require a client to always specify
               a field mask, producing an error if not.

               As with get operations, the location of the resource which
               describes the updated values in the request message depends on the
               operation kind. In any case, the effect of the field mask is
               required to be honored by the API.

               ## Considerations for HTTP REST

               The HTTP kind of an update operation which uses a field mask must
               be set to PATCH instead of PUT in order to satisfy HTTP semantics
               (PUT must only be used for full updates).

               # JSON Encoding of Field Masks

               In JSON, a field mask is encoded as a single string where paths are
               separated by a comma. Fields name in each path are converted
               to/from lower-camel naming conventions.

               As an example, consider the following message declarations:

                   message Profile {
                     User user = 1;
                     Photo photo = 2;
                   }
                   message User {
                     string display_name = 1;
                     string address = 2;
                   }

               In proto a field mask for `Profile` may look as such:

                   mask {
                     paths: "user.display_name"
                     paths: "photo"
                   }

               In JSON, the same mask is represented as below:

                   {
                     mask: "user.displayName,photo"
                   }

               # Field Masks and Oneof Fields

               Field masks treat fields in oneofs just as regular fields. Consider the
               following message:

                   message SampleMessage {
                     oneof test_oneof {
                       string name = 4;
                       SubMessage sub_message = 9;
                     }
                   }

               The field mask can be:

                   mask {
                     paths: "name"
                   }

               Or:

                   mask {
                     paths: "sub_message"
                   }

               Note that oneof type names ("test_oneof" in this case) cannot be used in
               paths.

               ## Field Mask Verification

               The implementation of any API method which has a FieldMask type field in the
               request should verify the included field paths, and return an
               `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error if any path is unmappable.

              `FieldMask` represents a set of symbolic field paths, for example:

                   paths: "f.a"
                   paths: "f.b.d"

               Here `f` represents a field in some root message, `a` and `b`
               fields in the message found in `f`, and `d` a field found in the
               message in `f.b`.

               Field masks are used to specify a subset of fields that should be
               returned by a get operation or modified by an update operation.
               Field masks also have a custom JSON encoding (see below).

               # Field Masks in Projections

               When used in the context of a projection, a response message or
               sub-message is filtered by the API to only contain those fields as
               specified in the mask. For example, if the mask in the previous
               example is applied to a response message as follows:

                   f {
                     a : 22
                     b {
                       d : 1
                       x : 2
                     }
                     y : 13
                   }
                   z: 8

               The result will not contain specific values for fields x,y and z
               (their value will be set to the default, and omitted in proto text
               output):


                   f {
                     a : 22
                     b {
                       d : 1
                     }
                   }

               A repeated field is not allowed except at the last position of a
               paths string.

               If a FieldMask object is not present in a get operation, the
               operation applies to all fields (as if a FieldMask of all fields
               had been specified).

               Note that a field mask does not necessarily apply to the
               top-level response message. In case of a REST get operation, the
               field mask applies directly to the response, but in case of a REST
               list operation, the mask instead applies to each individual message
               in the returned resource list. In case of a REST custom method,
               other definitions may be used. Where the mask applies will be
               clearly documented together with its declaration in the API.  In
               any case, the effect on the returned resource/resources is required
               behavior for APIs.

               # Field Masks in Update Operations

               A field mask in update operations specifies which fields of the
               targeted resource are going to be updated. The API is required
               to only change the values of the fields as specified in the mask
               and leave the others untouched. If a resource is passed in to
               describe the updated values, the API ignores the values of all
               fields not covered by the mask.

               If a repeated field is specified for an update operation, new values will
               be appended to the existing repeated field in the target resource. Note that
               a repeated field is only allowed in the last position of a `paths` string.

               If a sub-message is specified in the last position of the field mask for an
               update operation, then new value will be merged into the existing sub-message
               in the target resource.

               For example, given the target message:

                   f {
                     b {
                       d: 1
                       x: 2
                     }
                     c: [1]
                   }

               And an update message:

                   f {
                     b {
                       d: 10
                     }
                     c: [2]
                   }

               then if the field mask is:

                paths: ["f.b", "f.c"]

               then the result will be:

                   f {
                     b {
                       d: 10
                       x: 2
                     }
                     c: [1, 2]
                   }

               An implementation may provide options to override this default behavior for
               repeated and message fields.

               In order to reset a field's value to the default, the field must
               be in the mask and set to the default value in the provided resource.
               Hence, in order to reset all fields of a resource, provide a default
               instance of the resource and set all fields in the mask, or do
               not provide a mask as described below.

               If a field mask is not present on update, the operation applies to
               all fields (as if a field mask of all fields has been specified).
               Note that in the presence of schema evolution, this may mean that
               fields the client does not know and has therefore not filled into
               the request will be reset to their default. If this is unwanted
               behavior, a specific service may require a client to always specify
               a field mask, producing an error if not.

               As with get operations, the location of the resource which
               describes the updated values in the request message depends on the
               operation kind. In any case, the effect of the field mask is
               required to be honored by the API.

               ## Considerations for HTTP REST

               The HTTP kind of an update operation which uses a field mask must
               be set to PATCH instead of PUT in order to satisfy HTTP semantics
               (PUT must only be used for full updates).

               # JSON Encoding of Field Masks

               In JSON, a field mask is encoded as a single string where paths are
               separated by a comma. Fields name in each path are converted
               to/from lower-camel naming conventions.

               As an example, consider the following message declarations:

                   message Profile {
                     User user = 1;
                     Photo photo = 2;
                   }
                   message User {
                     string display_name = 1;
                     string address = 2;
                   }

               In proto a field mask for `Profile` may look as such:

                   mask {
                     paths: "user.display_name"
                     paths: "photo"
                   }

               In JSON, the same mask is represented as below:

                   {
                     mask: "user.displayName,photo"
                   }

               # Field Masks and Oneof Fields

               Field masks treat fields in oneofs just as regular fields. Consider the
               following message:

                   message SampleMessage {
                     oneof test_oneof {
                       string name = 4;
                       SubMessage sub_message = 9;
                     }
                   }

               The field mask can be:

                   mask {
                     paths: "name"
                   }

               Or:

                   mask {
                     paths: "sub_message"
                   }

               Note that oneof type names ("test_oneof" in this case) cannot be used in
               paths.

               ## Field Mask Verification

               The implementation of any API method which has a FieldMask type field in the
               request should verify the included field paths, and return an
               `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error if any path is unmappable.

              `FieldMask` represents a set of symbolic field paths, for example:

                   paths: "f.a"
                   paths: "f.b.d"

               Here `f` represents a field in some root message, `a` and `b`
               fields in the message found in `f`, and `d` a field found in the
               message in `f.b`.

               Field masks are used to specify a subset of fields that should be
               returned by a get operation or modified by an update operation.
               Field masks also have a custom JSON encoding (see below).

               # Field Masks in Projections

               When used in the context of a projection, a response message or
               sub-message is filtered by the API to only contain those fields as
               specified in the mask. For example, if the mask in the previous
               example is applied to a response message as follows:

                   f {
                     a : 22
                     b {
                       d : 1
                       x : 2
                     }
                     y : 13
                   }
                   z: 8

               The result will not contain specific values for fields x,y and z
               (their value will be set to the default, and omitted in proto text
               output):


                   f {
                     a : 22
                     b {
                       d : 1
                     }
                   }

               A repeated field is not allowed except at the last position of a
               paths string.

               If a FieldMask object is not present in a get operation, the
               operation applies to all fields (as if a FieldMask of all fields
               had been specified).

               Note that a field mask does not necessarily apply to the
               top-level response message. In case of a REST get operation, the
               field mask applies directly to the response, but in case of a REST
               list operation, the mask instead applies to each individual message
               in the returned resource list. In case of a REST custom method,
               other definitions may be used. Where the mask applies will be
               clearly documented together with its declaration in the API.  In
               any case, the effect on the returned resource/resources is required
               behavior for APIs.

               # Field Masks in Update Operations

               A field mask in update operations specifies which fields of the
               targeted resource are going to be updated. The API is required
               to only change the values of the fields as specified in the mask
               and leave the others untouched. If a resource is passed in to
               describe the updated values, the API ignores the values of all
               fields not covered by the mask.

               If a repeated field is specified for an update operation, new values will
               be appended to the existing repeated field in the target resource. Note that
               a repeated field is only allowed in the last position of a `paths` string.

               If a sub-message is specified in the last position of the field mask for an
               update operation, then new value will be merged into the existing sub-message
               in the target resource.

               For example, given the target message:

                   f {
                     b {
                       d: 1
                       x: 2
                     }
                     c: [1]
                   }

               And an update message:

                   f {
                     b {
                       d: 10
                     }
                     c: [2]
                   }

               then if the field mask is:

                paths: ["f.b", "f.c"]

               then the result will be:

                   f {
                     b {
                       d: 10
                       x: 2
                     }
                     c: [1, 2]
                   }

               An implementation may provide options to override this default behavior for
               repeated and message fields.

               In order to reset a field's value to the default, the field must
               be in the mask and set to the default value in the provided resource.
               Hence, in order to reset all fields of a resource, provide a default
               instance of the resource and set all fields in the mask, or do
               not provide a mask as described below.

               If a field mask is not present on update, the operation applies to
               all fields (as if a field mask of all fields has been specified).
               Note that in the presence of schema evolution, this may mean that
               fields the client does not know and has therefore not filled into
               the request will be reset to their default. If this is unwanted
               behavior, a specific service may require a client to always specify
               a field mask, producing an error if not.

               As with get operations, the location of the resource which
               describes the updated values in the request message depends on the
               operation kind. In any case, the effect of the field mask is
               required to be honored by the API.

               ## Considerations for HTTP REST

               The HTTP kind of an update operation which uses a field mask must
               be set to PATCH instead of PUT in order to satisfy HTTP semantics
               (PUT must only be used for full updates).

               # JSON Encoding of Field Masks

               In JSON, a field mask is encoded as a single string where paths are
               separated by a comma. Fields name in each path are converted
               to/from lower-camel naming conventions.

               As an example, consider the following message declarations:

                   message Profile {
                     User user = 1;
                     Photo photo = 2;
                   }
                   message User {
                     string display_name = 1;
                     string address = 2;
                   }

               In proto a field mask for `Profile` may look as such:

                   mask {
                     paths: "user.display_name"
                     paths: "photo"
                   }

               In JSON, the same mask is represented as below:

                   {
                     mask: "user.displayName,photo"
                   }

               # Field Masks and Oneof Fields

               Field masks treat fields in oneofs just as regular fields. Consider the
               following message:

                   message SampleMessage {
                     oneof test_oneof {
                       string name = 4;
                       SubMessage sub_message = 9;
                     }
                   }

               The field mask can be:

                   mask {
                     paths: "name"
                   }

               Or:

                   mask {
                     paths: "sub_message"
                   }

               Note that oneof type names ("test_oneof" in this case) cannot be used in
               paths.

               ## Field Mask Verification

               The implementation of any API method which has a FieldMask type field in the
               request should verify the included field paths, and return an
               `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error if any path is unmappable.

              `FieldMask` represents a set of symbolic field paths, for example:

                   paths: "f.a"
                   paths: "f.b.d"

               Here `f` represents a field in some root message, `a` and `b`
               fields in the message found in `f`, and `d` a field found in the
               message in `f.b`.

               Field masks are used to specify a subset of fields that should be
               returned by a get operation or modified by an update operation.
               Field masks also have a custom JSON encoding (see below).

               # Field Masks in Projections

               When used in the context of a projection, a response message or
               sub-message is filtered by the API to only contain those fields as
               specified in the mask. For example, if the mask in the previous
               example is applied to a response message as follows:

                   f {
                     a : 22
                     b {
                       d : 1
                       x : 2
                     }
                     y : 13
                   }
                   z: 8

               The result will not contain specific values for fields x,y and z
               (their value will be set to the default, and omitted in proto text
               output):


                   f {
                     a : 22
                     b {
                       d : 1
                     }
                   }

               A repeated field is not allowed except at the last position of a
               paths string.

               If a FieldMask object is not present in a get operation, the
               operation applies to all fields (as if a FieldMask of all fields
               had been specified).

               Note that a field mask does not necessarily apply to the
               top-level response message. In case of a REST get operation, the
               field mask applies directly to the response, but in case of a REST
               list operation, the mask instead applies to each individual message
               in the returned resource list. In case of a REST custom method,
               other definitions may be used. Where the mask applies will be
               clearly documented together with its declaration in the API.  In
               any case, the effect on the returned resource/resources is required
               behavior for APIs.

               # Field Masks in Update Operations

               A field mask in update operations specifies which fields of the
               targeted resource are going to be updated. The API is required
               to only change the values of the fields as specified in the mask
               and leave the others untouched. If a resource is passed in to
               describe the updated values, the API ignores the values of all
               fields not covered by the mask.

               If a repeated field is specified for an update operation, new values will
               be appended to the existing repeated field in the target resource. Note that
               a repeated field is only allowed in the last position of a `paths` string.

               If a sub-message is specified in the last position of the field mask for an
               update operation, then new value will be merged into the existing sub-message
               in the target resource.

               For example, given the target message:

                   f {
                     b {
                       d: 1
                       x: 2
                     }
                     c: [1]
                   }

               And an update message:

                   f {
                     b {
                       d: 10
                     }
                     c: [2]
                   }

               then if the field mask is:

                paths: ["f.b", "f.c"]

               then the result will be:

                   f {
                     b {
                       d: 10
                       x: 2
                     }
                     c: [1, 2]
                   }

               An implementation may provide options to override this default behavior for
               repeated and message fields.

               In order to reset a field's value to the default, the field must
               be in the mask and set to the default value in the provided resource.
               Hence, in order to reset all fields of a resource, provide a default
               instance of the resource and set all fields in the mask, or do
               not provide a mask as described below.

               If a field mask is not present on update, the operation applies to
               all fields (as if a field mask of all fields has been specified).
               Note that in the presence of schema evolution, this may mean that
               fields the client does not know and has therefore not filled into
               the request will be reset to their default. If this is unwanted
               behavior, a specific service may require a client to always specify
               a field mask, producing an error if not.

               As with get operations, the location of the resource which
               describes the updated values in the request message depends on the
               operation kind. In any case, the effect of the field mask is
               required to be honored by the API.

               ## Considerations for HTTP REST

               The HTTP kind of an update operation which uses a field mask must
               be set to PATCH instead of PUT in order to satisfy HTTP semantics
               (PUT must only be used for full updates).

               # JSON Encoding of Field Masks

               In JSON, a field mask is encoded as a single string where paths are
               separated by a comma. Fields name in each path are converted
               to/from lower-camel naming conventions.

               As an example, consider the following message declarations:

                   message Profile {
                     User user = 1;
                     Photo photo = 2;
                   }
                   message User {
                     string display_name = 1;
                     string address = 2;
                   }

               In proto a field mask for `Profile` may look as such:

                   mask {
                     paths: "user.display_name"
                     paths: "photo"
                   }

               In JSON, the same mask is represented as below:

                   {
                     mask: "user.displayName,photo"
                   }

               # Field Masks and Oneof Fields

               Field masks treat fields in oneofs just as regular fields. Consider the
               following message:

                   message SampleMessage {
                     oneof test_oneof {
                       string name = 4;
                       SubMessage sub_message = 9;
                     }
                   }

               The field mask can be:

                   mask {
                     paths: "name"
                   }

               Or:

                   mask {
                     paths: "sub_message"
                   }

               Note that oneof type names ("test_oneof" in this case) cannot be used in
               paths.

               ## Field Mask Verification

               The implementation of any API method which has a FieldMask type field in the
               request should verify the included field paths, and return an
               `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error if any path is unmappable.

              `FieldMask` represents a set of symbolic field paths, for example:

                   paths: "f.a"
                   paths: "f.b.d"

               Here `f` represents a field in some root message, `a` and `b`
               fields in the message found in `f`, and `d` a field found in the
               message in `f.b`.

               Field masks are used to specify a subset of fields that should be
               returned by a get operation or modified by an update operation.
               Field masks also have a custom JSON encoding (see below).

               # Field Masks in Projections

               When used in the context of a projection, a response message or
               sub-message is filtered by the API to only contain those fields as
               specified in the mask. For example, if the mask in the previous
               example is applied to a response message as follows:

                   f {
                     a : 22
                     b {
                       d : 1
                       x : 2
                     }
                     y : 13
                   }
                   z: 8

               The result will not contain specific values for fields x,y and z
               (their value will be set to the default, and omitted in proto text
               output):


                   f {
                     a : 22
                     b {
                       d : 1
                     }
                   }

               A repeated field is not allowed except at the last position of a
               paths string.

               If a FieldMask object is not present in a get operation, the
               operation applies to all fields (as if a FieldMask of all fields
               had been specified).

               Note that a field mask does not necessarily apply to the
               top-level response message. In case of a REST get operation, the
               field mask applies directly to the response, but in case of a REST
               list operation, the mask instead applies to each individual message
               in the returned resource list. In case of a REST custom method,
               other definitions may be used. Where the mask applies will be
               clearly documented together with its declaration in the API.  In
               any case, the effect on the returned resource/resources is required
               behavior for APIs.

               # Field Masks in Update Operations

               A field mask in update operations specifies which fields of the
               targeted resource are going to be updated. The API is required
               to only change the values of the fields as specified in the mask
               and leave the others untouched. If a resource is passed in to
               describe the updated values, the API ignores the values of all
               fields not covered by the mask.

               If a repeated field is specified for an update operation, new values will
               be appended to the existing repeated field in the target resource. Note that
               a repeated field is only allowed in the last position of a `paths` string.

               If a sub-message is specified in the last position of the field mask for an
               update operation, then new value will be merged into the existing sub-message
               in the target resource.

               For example, given the target message:

                   f {
                     b {
                       d: 1
                       x: 2
                     }
                     c: [1]
                   }

               And an update message:

                   f {
                     b {
                       d: 10
                     }
                     c: [2]
                   }

               then if the field mask is:

                paths: ["f.b", "f.c"]

               then the result will be:

                   f {
                     b {
                       d: 10
                       x: 2
                     }
                     c: [1, 2]
                   }

               An implementation may provide options to override this default behavior for
               repeated and message fields.

               In order to reset a field's value to the default, the field must
               be in the mask and set to the default value in the provided resource.
               Hence, in order to reset all fields of a resource, provide a default
               instance of the resource and set all fields in the mask, or do
               not provide a mask as described below.

               If a field mask is not present on update, the operation applies to
               all fields (as if a field mask of all fields has been specified).
               Note that in the presence of schema evolution, this may mean that
               fields the client does not know and has therefore not filled into
               the request will be reset to their default. If this is unwanted
               behavior, a specific service may require a client to always specify
               a field mask, producing an error if not.

               As with get operations, the location of the resource which
               describes the updated values in the request message depends on the
               operation kind. In any case, the effect of the field mask is
               required to be honored by the API.

               ## Considerations for HTTP REST

               The HTTP kind of an update operation which uses a field mask must
               be set to PATCH instead of PUT in order to satisfy HTTP semantics
               (PUT must only be used for full updates).

               # JSON Encoding of Field Masks

               In JSON, a field mask is encoded as a single string where paths are
               separated by a comma. Fields name in each path are converted
               to/from lower-camel naming conventions.

               As an example, consider the following message declarations:

                   message Profile {
                     User user = 1;
                     Photo photo = 2;
                   }
                   message User {
                     string display_name = 1;
                     string address = 2;
                   }

               In proto a field mask for `Profile` may look as such:

                   mask {
                     paths: "user.display_name"
                     paths: "photo"
                   }

               In JSON, the same mask is represented as below:

                   {
                     mask: "user.displayName,photo"
                   }

               # Field Masks and Oneof Fields

               Field masks treat fields in oneofs just as regular fields. Consider the
               following message:

                   message SampleMessage {
                     oneof test_oneof {
                       string name = 4;
                       SubMessage sub_message = 9;
                     }
                   }

               The field mask can be:

                   mask {
                     paths: "name"
                   }

               Or:

                   mask {
                     paths: "sub_message"
                   }

               Note that oneof type names ("test_oneof" in this case) cannot be used in
               paths.

               ## Field Mask Verification

               The implementation of any API method which has a FieldMask type field in the
               request should verify the included field paths, and return an
               `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error if any path is unmappable.

              `FieldMask` represents a set of symbolic field paths, for example:

                   paths: "f.a"
                   paths: "f.b.d"

               Here `f` represents a field in some root message, `a` and `b`
               fields in the message found in `f`, and `d` a field found in the
               message in `f.b`.

               Field masks are used to specify a subset of fields that should be
               returned by a get operation or modified by an update operation.
               Field masks also have a custom JSON encoding (see below).

               # Field Masks in Projections

               When used in the context of a projection, a response message or
               sub-message is filtered by the API to only contain those fields as
               specified in the mask. For example, if the mask in the previous
               example is applied to a response message as follows:

                   f {
                     a : 22
                     b {
                       d : 1
                       x : 2
                     }
                     y : 13
                   }
                   z: 8

               The result will not contain specific values for fields x,y and z
               (their value will be set to the default, and omitted in proto text
               output):


                   f {
                     a : 22
                     b {
                       d : 1
                     }
                   }

               A repeated field is not allowed except at the last position of a
               paths string.

               If a FieldMask object is not present in a get operation, the
               operation applies to all fields (as if a FieldMask of all fields
               had been specified).

               Note that a field mask does not necessarily apply to the
               top-level response message. In case of a REST get operation, the
               field mask applies directly to the response, but in case of a REST
               list operation, the mask instead applies to each individual message
               in the returned resource list. In case of a REST custom method,
               other definitions may be used. Where the mask applies will be
               clearly documented together with its declaration in the API.  In
               any case, the effect on the returned resource/resources is required
               behavior for APIs.

               # Field Masks in Update Operations

               A field mask in update operations specifies which fields of the
               targeted resource are going to be updated. The API is required
               to only change the values of the fields as specified in the mask
               and leave the others untouched. If a resource is passed in to
               describe the updated values, the API ignores the values of all
               fields not covered by the mask.

               If a repeated field is specified for an update operation, new values will
               be appended to the existing repeated field in the target resource. Note that
               a repeated field is only allowed in the last position of a `paths` string.

               If a sub-message is specified in the last position of the field mask for an
               update operation, then new value will be merged into the existing sub-message
               in the target resource.

               For example, given the target message:

                   f {
                     b {
                       d: 1
                       x: 2
                     }
                     c: [1]
                   }

               And an update message:

                   f {
                     b {
                       d: 10
                     }
                     c: [2]
                   }

               then if the field mask is:

                paths: ["f.b", "f.c"]

               then the result will be:

                   f {
                     b {
                       d: 10
                       x: 2
                     }
                     c: [1, 2]
                   }

               An implementation may provide options to override this default behavior for
               repeated and message fields.

               In order to reset a field's value to the default, the field must
               be in the mask and set to the default value in the provided resource.
               Hence, in order to reset all fields of a resource, provide a default
               instance of the resource and set all fields in the mask, or do
               not provide a mask as described below.

               If a field mask is not present on update, the operation applies to
               all fields (as if a field mask of all fields has been specified).
               Note that in the presence of schema evolution, this may mean that
               fields the client does not know and has therefore not filled into
               the request will be reset to their default. If this is unwanted
               behavior, a specific service may require a client to always specify
               a field mask, producing an error if not.

               As with get operations, the location of the resource which
               describes the updated values in the request message depends on the
               operation kind. In any case, the effect of the field mask is
               required to be honored by the API.

               ## Considerations for HTTP REST

               The HTTP kind of an update operation which uses a field mask must
               be set to PATCH instead of PUT in order to satisfy HTTP semantics
               (PUT must only be used for full updates).

               # JSON Encoding of Field Masks

               In JSON, a field mask is encoded as a single string where paths are
               separated by a comma. Fields name in each path are converted
               to/from lower-camel naming conventions.

               As an example, consider the following message declarations:

                   message Profile {
                     User user = 1;
                     Photo photo = 2;
                   }
                   message User {
                     string display_name = 1;
                     string address = 2;
                   }

               In proto a field mask for `Profile` may look as such:

                   mask {
                     paths: "user.display_name"
                     paths: "photo"
                   }

               In JSON, the same mask is represented as below:

                   {
                     mask: "user.displayName,photo"
                   }

               # Field Masks and Oneof Fields

               Field masks treat fields in oneofs just as regular fields. Consider the
               following message:

                   message SampleMessage {
                     oneof test_oneof {
                       string name = 4;
                       SubMessage sub_message = 9;
                     }
                   }

               The field mask can be:

                   mask {
                     paths: "name"
                   }

               Or:

                   mask {
                     paths: "sub_message"
                   }

               Note that oneof type names ("test_oneof" in this case) cannot be used in
               paths.

               ## Field Mask Verification

               The implementation of any API method which has a FieldMask type field in the
               request should verify the included field paths, and return an
               `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error if any path is unmappable.

              `FieldMask` represents a set of symbolic field paths, for example:

                   paths: "f.a"
                   paths: "f.b.d"

               Here `f` represents a field in some root message, `a` and `b`
               fields in the message found in `f`, and `d` a field found in the
               message in `f.b`.

               Field masks are used to specify a subset of fields that should be
               returned by a get operation or modified by an update operation.
               Field masks also have a custom JSON encoding (see below).

               # Field Masks in Projections

               When used in the context of a projection, a response message or
               sub-message is filtered by the API to only contain those fields as
               specified in the mask. For example, if the mask in the previous
               example is applied to a response message as follows:

                   f {
                     a : 22
                     b {
                       d : 1
                       x : 2
                     }
                     y : 13
                   }
                   z: 8

               The result will not contain specific values for fields x,y and z
               (their value will be set to the default, and omitted in proto text
               output):


                   f {
                     a : 22
                     b {
                       d : 1
                     }
                   }

               A repeated field is not allowed except at the last position of a
               paths string.

               If a FieldMask object is not present in a get operation, the
               operation applies to all fields (as if a FieldMask of all fields
               had been specified).

               Note that a field mask does not necessarily apply to the
               top-level response message. In case of a REST get operation, the
               field mask applies directly to the response, but in case of a REST
               list operation, the mask instead applies to each individual message
               in the returned resource list. In case of a REST custom method,
               other definitions may be used. Where the mask applies will be
               clearly documented together with its declaration in the API.  In
               any case, the effect on the returned resource/resources is required
               behavior for APIs.

               # Field Masks in Update Operations

               A field mask in update operations specifies which fields of the
               targeted resource are going to be updated. The API is required
               to only change the values of the fields as specified in the mask
               and leave the others untouched. If a resource is passed in to
               describe the updated values, the API ignores the values of all
               fields not covered by the mask.

               If a repeated field is specified for an update operation, new values will
               be appended to the existing repeated field in the target resource. Note that
               a repeated field is only allowed in the last position of a `paths` string.

               If a sub-message is specified in the last position of the field mask for an
               update operation, then new value will be merged into the existing sub-message
               in the target resource.

               For example, given the target message:

                   f {
                     b {
                       d: 1
                       x: 2
                     }
                     c: [1]
                   }

               And an update message:

                   f {
                     b {
                       d: 10
                     }
                     c: [2]
                   }

               then if the field mask is:

                paths: ["f.b", "f.c"]

               then the result will be:

                   f {
                     b {
                       d: 10
                       x: 2
                     }
                     c: [1, 2]
                   }

               An implementation may provide options to override this default behavior for
               repeated and message fields.

               In order to reset a field's value to the default, the field must
               be in the mask and set to the default value in the provided resource.
               Hence, in order to reset all fields of a resource, provide a default
               instance of the resource and set all fields in the mask, or do
               not provide a mask as described below.

               If a field mask is not present on update, the operation applies to
               all fields (as if a field mask of all fields has been specified).
               Note that in the presence of schema evolution, this may mean that
               fields the client does not know and has therefore not filled into
               the request will be reset to their default. If this is unwanted
               behavior, a specific service may require a client to always specify
               a field mask, producing an error if not.

               As with get operations, the location of the resource which
               describes the updated values in the request message depends on the
               operation kind. In any case, the effect of the field mask is
               required to be honored by the API.

               ## Considerations for HTTP REST

               The HTTP kind of an update operation which uses a field mask must
               be set to PATCH instead of PUT in order to satisfy HTTP semantics
               (PUT must only be used for full updates).

               # JSON Encoding of Field Masks

               In JSON, a field mask is encoded as a single string where paths are
               separated by a comma. Fields name in each path are converted
               to/from lower-camel naming conventions.

               As an example, consider the following message declarations:

                   message Profile {
                     User user = 1;
                     Photo photo = 2;
                   }
                   message User {
                     string display_name = 1;
                     string address = 2;
                   }

               In proto a field mask for `Profile` may look as such:

                   mask {
                     paths: "user.display_name"
                     paths: "photo"
                   }

               In JSON, the same mask is represented as below:

                   {
                     mask: "user.displayName,photo"
                   }

               # Field Masks and Oneof Fields

               Field masks treat fields in oneofs just as regular fields. Consider the
               following message:

                   message SampleMessage {
                     oneof test_oneof {
                       string name = 4;
                       SubMessage sub_message = 9;
                     }
                   }

               The field mask can be:

                   mask {
                     paths: "name"
                   }

               Or:

                   mask {
                     paths: "sub_message"
                   }

               Note that oneof type names ("test_oneof" in this case) cannot be used in
               paths.

               ## Field Mask Verification

               The implementation of any API method which has a FieldMask type field in the
               request should verify the included field paths, and return an
               `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error if any path is unmappable.

              `FieldMask` represents a set of symbolic field paths, for example:

                   paths: "f.a"
                   paths: "f.b.d"

               Here `f` represents a field in some root message, `a` and `b`
               fields in the message found in `f`, and `d` a field found in the
               message in `f.b`.

               Field masks are used to specify a subset of fields that should be
               returned by a get operation or modified by an update operation.
               Field masks also have a custom JSON encoding (see below).

               # Field Masks in Projections

               When used in the context of a projection, a response message or
               sub-message is filtered by the API to only contain those fields as
               specified in the mask. For example, if the mask in the previous
               example is applied to a response message as follows:

                   f {
                     a : 22
                     b {
                       d : 1
                       x : 2
                     }
                     y : 13
                   }
                   z: 8

               The result will not contain specific values for fields x,y and z
               (their value will be set to the default, and omitted in proto text
               output):


                   f {
                     a : 22
                     b {
                       d : 1
                     }
                   }

               A repeated field is not allowed except at the last position of a
               paths string.

               If a FieldMask object is not present in a get operation, the
               operation applies to all fields (as if a FieldMask of all fields
               had been specified).

               Note that a field mask does not necessarily apply to the
               top-level response message. In case of a REST get operation, the
               field mask applies directly to the response, but in case of a REST
               list operation, the mask instead applies to each individual message
               in the returned resource list. In case of a REST custom method,
               other definitions may be used. Where the mask applies will be
               clearly documented together with its declaration in the API.  In
               any case, the effect on the returned resource/resources is required
               behavior for APIs.

               # Field Masks in Update Operations

               A field mask in update operations specifies which fields of the
               targeted resource are going to be updated. The API is required
               to only change the values of the fields as specified in the mask
               and leave the others untouched. If a resource is passed in to
               describe the updated values, the API ignores the values of all
               fields not covered by the mask.

               If a repeated field is specified for an update operation, new values will
               be appended to the existing repeated field in the target resource. Note that
               a repeated field is only allowed in the last position of a `paths` string.

               If a sub-message is specified in the last position of the field mask for an
               update operation, then new value will be merged into the existing sub-message
               in the target resource.

               For example, given the target message:

                   f {
                     b {
                       d: 1
                       x: 2
                     }
                     c: [1]
                   }

               And an update message:

                   f {
                     b {
                       d: 10
                     }
                     c: [2]
                   }

               then if the field mask is:

                paths: ["f.b", "f.c"]

               then the result will be:

                   f {
                     b {
                       d: 10
                       x: 2
                     }
                     c: [1, 2]
                   }

               An implementation may provide options to override this default behavior for
               repeated and message fields.

               In order to reset a field's value to the default, the field must
               be in the mask and set to the default value in the provided resource.
               Hence, in order to reset all fields of a resource, provide a default
               instance of the resource and set all fields in the mask, or do
               not provide a mask as described below.

               If a field mask is not present on update, the operation applies to
               all fields (as if a field mask of all fields has been specified).
               Note that in the presence of schema evolution, this may mean that
               fields the client does not know and has therefore not filled into
               the request will be reset to their default. If this is unwanted
               behavior, a specific service may require a client to always specify
               a field mask, producing an error if not.

               As with get operations, the location of the resource which
               describes the updated values in the request message depends on the
               operation kind. In any case, the effect of the field mask is
               required to be honored by the API.

               ## Considerations for HTTP REST

               The HTTP kind of an update operation which uses a field mask must
               be set to PATCH instead of PUT in order to satisfy HTTP semantics
               (PUT must only be used for full updates).

               # JSON Encoding of Field Masks

               In JSON, a field mask is encoded as a single string where paths are
               separated by a comma. Fields name in each path are converted
               to/from lower-camel naming conventions.

               As an example, consider the following message declarations:

                   message Profile {
                     User user = 1;
                     Photo photo = 2;
                   }
                   message User {
                     string display_name = 1;
                     string address = 2;
                   }

               In proto a field mask for `Profile` may look as such:

                   mask {
                     paths: "user.display_name"
                     paths: "photo"
                   }

               In JSON, the same mask is represented as below:

                   {
                     mask: "user.displayName,photo"
                   }

               # Field Masks and Oneof Fields

               Field masks treat fields in oneofs just as regular fields. Consider the
               following message:

                   message SampleMessage {
                     oneof test_oneof {
                       string name = 4;
                       SubMessage sub_message = 9;
                     }
                   }

               The field mask can be:

                   mask {
                     paths: "name"
                   }

               Or:

                   mask {
                     paths: "sub_message"
                   }

               Note that oneof type names ("test_oneof" in this case) cannot be used in
               paths.

               ## Field Mask Verification

               The implementation of any API method which has a FieldMask type field in the
               request should verify the included field paths, and return an
               `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error if any path is unmappable.

              `FieldMask` represents a set of symbolic field paths, for example:

                   paths: "f.a"
                   paths: "f.b.d"

               Here `f` represents a field in some root message, `a` and `b`
               fields in the message found in `f`, and `d` a field found in the
               message in `f.b`.

               Field masks are used to specify a subset of fields that should be
               returned by a get operation or modified by an update operation.
               Field masks also have a custom JSON encoding (see below).

               # Field Masks in Projections

               When used in the context of a projection, a response message or
               sub-message is filtered by the API to only contain those fields as
               specified in the mask. For example, if the mask in the previous
               example is applied to a response message as follows:

                   f {
                     a : 22
                     b {
                       d : 1
                       x : 2
                     }
                     y : 13
                   }
                   z: 8

               The result will not contain specific values for fields x,y and z
               (their value will be set to the default, and omitted in proto text
               output):


                   f {
                     a : 22
                     b {
                       d : 1
                     }
                   }

               A repeated field is not allowed except at the last position of a
               paths string.

               If a FieldMask object is not present in a get operation, the
               operation applies to all fields (as if a FieldMask of all fields
               had been specified).

               Note that a field mask does not necessarily apply to the
               top-level response message. In case of a REST get operation, the
               field mask applies directly to the response, but in case of a REST
               list operation, the mask instead applies to each individual message
               in the returned resource list. In case of a REST custom method,
               other definitions may be used. Where the mask applies will be
               clearly documented together with its declaration in the API.  In
               any case, the effect on the returned resource/resources is required
               behavior for APIs.

               # Field Masks in Update Operations

               A field mask in update operations specifies which fields of the
               targeted resource are going to be updated. The API is required
               to only change the values of the fields as specified in the mask
               and leave the others untouched. If a resource is passed in to
               describe the updated values, the API ignores the values of all
               fields not covered by the mask.

               If a repeated field is specified for an update operation, new values will
               be appended to the existing repeated field in the target resource. Note that
               a repeated field is only allowed in the last position of a `paths` string.

               If a sub-message is specified in the last position of the field mask for an
               update operation, then new value will be merged into the existing sub-message
               in the target resource.

               For example, given the target message:

                   f {
                     b {
                       d: 1
                       x: 2
                     }
                     c: [1]
                   }

               And an update message:

                   f {
                     b {
                       d: 10
                     }
                     c: [2]
                   }

               then if the field mask is:

                paths: ["f.b", "f.c"]

               then the result will be:

                   f {
                     b {
                       d: 10
                       x: 2
                     }
                     c: [1, 2]
                   }

               An implementation may provide options to override this default behavior for
               repeated and message fields.

               In order to reset a field's value to the default, the field must
               be in the mask and set to the default value in the provided resource.
               Hence, in order to reset all fields of a resource, provide a default
               instance of the resource and set all fields in the mask, or do
               not provide a mask as described below.

               If a field mask is not present on update, the operation applies to
               all fields (as if a field mask of all fields has been specified).
               Note that in the presence of schema evolution, this may mean that
               fields the client does not know and has therefore not filled into
               the request will be reset to their default. If this is unwanted
               behavior, a specific service may require a client to always specify
               a field mask, producing an error if not.

               As with get operations, the location of the resource which
               describes the updated values in the request message depends on the
               operation kind. In any case, the effect of the field mask is
               required to be honored by the API.

               ## Considerations for HTTP REST

               The HTTP kind of an update operation which uses a field mask must
               be set to PATCH instead of PUT in order to satisfy HTTP semantics
               (PUT must only be used for full updates).

               # JSON Encoding of Field Masks

               In JSON, a field mask is encoded as a single string where paths are
               separated by a comma. Fields name in each path are converted
               to/from lower-camel naming conventions.

               As an example, consider the following message declarations:

                   message Profile {
                     User user = 1;
                     Photo photo = 2;
                   }
                   message User {
                     string display_name = 1;
                     string address = 2;
                   }

               In proto a field mask for `Profile` may look as such:

                   mask {
                     paths: "user.display_name"
                     paths: "photo"
                   }

               In JSON, the same mask is represented as below:

                   {
                     mask: "user.displayName,photo"
                   }

               # Field Masks and Oneof Fields

               Field masks treat fields in oneofs just as regular fields. Consider the
               following message:

                   message SampleMessage {
                     oneof test_oneof {
                       string name = 4;
                       SubMessage sub_message = 9;
                     }
                   }

               The field mask can be:

                   mask {
                     paths: "name"
                   }

               Or:

                   mask {
                     paths: "sub_message"
                   }

               Note that oneof type names ("test_oneof" in this case) cannot be used in
               paths.

               ## Field Mask Verification

               The implementation of any API method which has a FieldMask type field in the
               request should verify the included field paths, and return an
               `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error if any path is unmappable.

              `FieldMask` represents a set of symbolic field paths, for example:

                   paths: "f.a"
                   paths: "f.b.d"

               Here `f` represents a field in some root message, `a` and `b`
               fields in the message found in `f`, and `d` a field found in the
               message in `f.b`.

               Field masks are used to specify a subset of fields that should be
               returned by a get operation or modified by an update operation.
               Field masks also have a custom JSON encoding (see below).

               # Field Masks in Projections

               When used in the context of a projection, a response message or
               sub-message is filtered by the API to only contain those fields as
               specified in the mask. For example, if the mask in the previous
               example is applied to a response message as follows:

                   f {
                     a : 22
                     b {
                       d : 1
                       x : 2
                     }
                     y : 13
                   }
                   z: 8

               The result will not contain specific values for fields x,y and z
               (their value will be set to the default, and omitted in proto text
               output):


                   f {
                     a : 22
                     b {
                       d : 1
                     }
                   }

               A repeated field is not allowed except at the last position of a
               paths string.

               If a FieldMask object is not present in a get operation, the
               operation applies to all fields (as if a FieldMask of all fields
               had been specified).

               Note that a field mask does not necessarily apply to the
               top-level response message. In case of a REST get operation, the
               field mask applies directly to the response, but in case of a REST
               list operation, the mask instead applies to each individual message
               in the returned resource list. In case of a REST custom method,
               other definitions may be used. Where the mask applies will be
               clearly documented together with its declaration in the API.  In
               any case, the effect on the returned resource/resources is required
               behavior for APIs.

               # Field Masks in Update Operations

               A field mask in update operations specifies which fields of the
               targeted resource are going to be updated. The API is required
               to only change the values of the fields as specified in the mask
               and leave the others untouched. If a resource is passed in to
               describe the updated values, the API ignores the values of all
               fields not covered by the mask.

               If a repeated field is specified for an update operation, new values will
               be appended to the existing repeated field in the target resource. Note that
               a repeated field is only allowed in the last position of a `paths` string.

               If a sub-message is specified in the last position of the field mask for an
               update operation, then new value will be merged into the existing sub-message
               in the target resource.

               For example, given the target message:

                   f {
                     b {
                       d: 1
                       x: 2
                     }
                     c: [1]
                   }

               And an update message:

                   f {
                     b {
                       d: 10
                     }
                     c: [2]
                   }

               then if the field mask is:

                paths: ["f.b", "f.c"]

               then the result will be:

                   f {
                     b {
                       d: 10
                       x: 2
                     }
                     c: [1, 2]
                   }

               An implementation may provide options to override this default behavior for
               repeated and message fields.

               In order to reset a field's value to the default, the field must
               be in the mask and set to the default value in the provided resource.
               Hence, in order to reset all fields of a resource, provide a default
               instance of the resource and set all fields in the mask, or do
               not provide a mask as described below.

               If a field mask is not present on update, the operation applies to
               all fields (as if a field mask of all fields has been specified).
               Note that in the presence of schema evolution, this may mean that
               fields the client does not know and has therefore not filled into
               the request will be reset to their default. If this is unwanted
               behavior, a specific service may require a client to always specify
               a field mask, producing an error if not.

               As with get operations, the location of the resource which
               describes the updated values in the request message depends on the
               operation kind. In any case, the effect of the field mask is
               required to be honored by the API.

               ## Considerations for HTTP REST

               The HTTP kind of an update operation which uses a field mask must
               be set to PATCH instead of PUT in order to satisfy HTTP semantics
               (PUT must only be used for full updates).

               # JSON Encoding of Field Masks

               In JSON, a field mask is encoded as a single string where paths are
               separated by a comma. Fields name in each path are converted
               to/from lower-camel naming conventions.

               As an example, consider the following message declarations:

                   message Profile {
                     User user = 1;
                     Photo photo = 2;
                   }
                   message User {
                     string display_name = 1;
                     string address = 2;
                   }

               In proto a field mask for `Profile` may look as such:

                   mask {
                     paths: "user.display_name"
                     paths: "photo"
                   }

               In JSON, the same mask is represented as below:

                   {
                     mask: "user.displayName,photo"
                   }

               # Field Masks and Oneof Fields

               Field masks treat fields in oneofs just as regular fields. Consider the
               following message:

                   message SampleMessage {
                     oneof test_oneof {
                       string name = 4;
                       SubMessage sub_message = 9;
                     }
                   }

               The field mask can be:

                   mask {
                     paths: "name"
                   }

               Or:

                   mask {
                     paths: "sub_message"
                   }

               Note that oneof type names ("test_oneof" in this case) cannot be used in
               paths.

               ## Field Mask Verification

               The implementation of any API method which has a FieldMask type field in the
               request should verify the included field paths, and return an
               `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error if any path is unmappable.

              `FieldMask` represents a set of symbolic field paths, for example:

                   paths: "f.a"
                   paths: "f.b.d"

               Here `f` represents a field in some root message, `a` and `b`
               fields in the message found in `f`, and `d` a field found in the
               message in `f.b`.

               Field masks are used to specify a subset of fields that should be
               returned by a get operation or modified by an update operation.
               Field masks also have a custom JSON encoding (see below).

               # Field Masks in Projections

               When used in the context of a projection, a response message or
               sub-message is filtered by the API to only contain those fields as
               specified in the mask. For example, if the mask in the previous
               example is applied to a response message as follows:

                   f {
                     a : 22
                     b {
                       d : 1
                       x : 2
                     }
                     y : 13
                   }
                   z: 8

               The result will not contain specific values for fields x,y and z
               (their value will be set to the default, and omitted in proto text
               output):


                   f {
                     a : 22
                     b {
                       d : 1
                     }
                   }

               A repeated field is not allowed except at the last position of a
               paths string.

               If a FieldMask object is not present in a get operation, the
               operation applies to all fields (as if a FieldMask of all fields
               had been specified).

               Note that a field mask does not necessarily apply to the
               top-level response message. In case of a REST get operation, the
               field mask applies directly to the response, but in case of a REST
               list operation, the mask instead applies to each individual message
               in the returned resource list. In case of a REST custom method,
               other definitions may be used. Where the mask applies will be
               clearly documented together with its declaration in the API.  In
               any case, the effect on the returned resource/resources is required
               behavior for APIs.

               # Field Masks in Update Operations

               A field mask in update operations specifies which fields of the
               targeted resource are going to be updated. The API is required
               to only change the values of the fields as specified in the mask
               and leave the others untouched. If a resource is passed in to
               describe the updated values, the API ignores the values of all
               fields not covered by the mask.

               If a repeated field is specified for an update operation, new values will
               be appended to the existing repeated field in the target resource. Note that
               a repeated field is only allowed in the last position of a `paths` string.

               If a sub-message is specified in the last position of the field mask for an
               update operation, then new value will be merged into the existing sub-message
               in the target resource.

               For example, given the target message:

                   f {
                     b {
                       d: 1
                       x: 2
                     }
                     c: [1]
                   }

               And an update message:

                   f {
                     b {
                       d: 10
                     }
                     c: [2]
                   }

               then if the field mask is:

                paths: ["f.b", "f.c"]

               then the result will be:

                   f {
                     b {
                       d: 10
                       x: 2
                     }
                     c: [1, 2]
                   }

               An implementation may provide options to override this default behavior for
               repeated and message fields.

               In order to reset a field's value to the default, the field must
               be in the mask and set to the default value in the provided resource.
               Hence, in order to reset all fields of a resource, provide a default
               instance of the resource and set all fields in the mask, or do
               not provide a mask as described below.

               If a field mask is not present on update, the operation applies to
               all fields (as if a field mask of all fields has been specified).
               Note that in the presence of schema evolution, this may mean that
               fields the client does not know and has therefore not filled into
               the request will be reset to their default. If this is unwanted
               behavior, a specific service may require a client to always specify
               a field mask, producing an error if not.

               As with get operations, the location of the resource which
               describes the updated values in the request message depends on the
               operation kind. In any case, the effect of the field mask is
               required to be honored by the API.

               ## Considerations for HTTP REST

               The HTTP kind of an update operation which uses a field mask must
               be set to PATCH instead of PUT in order to satisfy HTTP semantics
               (PUT must only be used for full updates).

               # JSON Encoding of Field Masks

               In JSON, a field mask is encoded as a single string where paths are
               separated by a comma. Fields name in each path are converted
               to/from lower-camel naming conventions.

               As an example, consider the following message declarations:

                   message Profile {
                     User user = 1;
                     Photo photo = 2;
                   }
                   message User {
                     string display_name = 1;
                     string address = 2;
                   }

               In proto a field mask for `Profile` may look as such:

                   mask {
                     paths: "user.display_name"
                     paths: "photo"
                   }

               In JSON, the same mask is represented as below:

                   {
                     mask: "user.displayName,photo"
                   }

               # Field Masks and Oneof Fields

               Field masks treat fields in oneofs just as regular fields. Consider the
               following message:

                   message SampleMessage {
                     oneof test_oneof {
                       string name = 4;
                       SubMessage sub_message = 9;
                     }
                   }

               The field mask can be:

                   mask {
                     paths: "name"
                   }

               Or:

                   mask {
                     paths: "sub_message"
                   }

               Note that oneof type names ("test_oneof" in this case) cannot be used in
               paths.

               ## Field Mask Verification

               The implementation of any API method which has a FieldMask type field in the
               request should verify the included field paths, and return an
               `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error if any path is unmappable.

              `FieldMask` represents a set of symbolic field paths, for example:

                   paths: "f.a"
                   paths: "f.b.d"

               Here `f` represents a field in some root message, `a` and `b`
               fields in the message found in `f`, and `d` a field found in the
               message in `f.b`.

               Field masks are used to specify a subset of fields that should be
               returned by a get operation or modified by an update operation.
               Field masks also have a custom JSON encoding (see below).

               # Field Masks in Projections

               When used in the context of a projection, a response message or
               sub-message is filtered by the API to only contain those fields as
               specified in the mask. For example, if the mask in the previous
               example is applied to a response message as follows:

                   f {
                     a : 22
                     b {
                       d : 1
                       x : 2
                     }
                     y : 13
                   }
                   z: 8

               The result will not contain specific values for fields x,y and z
               (their value will be set to the default, and omitted in proto text
               output):


                   f {
                     a : 22
                     b {
                       d : 1
                     }
                   }

               A repeated field is not allowed except at the last position of a
               paths string.

               If a FieldMask object is not present in a get operation, the
               operation applies to all fields (as if a FieldMask of all fields
               had been specified).

               Note that a field mask does not necessarily apply to the
               top-level response message. In case of a REST get operation, the
               field mask applies directly to the response, but in case of a REST
               list operation, the mask instead applies to each individual message
               in the returned resource list. In case of a REST custom method,
               other definitions may be used. Where the mask applies will be
               clearly documented together with its declaration in the API.  In
               any case, the effect on the returned resource/resources is required
               behavior for APIs.

               # Field Masks in Update Operations

               A field mask in update operations specifies which fields of the
               targeted resource are going to be updated. The API is required
               to only change the values of the fields as specified in the mask
               and leave the others untouched. If a resource is passed in to
               describe the updated values, the API ignores the values of all
               fields not covered by the mask.

               If a repeated field is specified for an update operation, new values will
               be appended to the existing repeated field in the target resource. Note that
               a repeated field is only allowed in the last position of a `paths` string.

               If a sub-message is specified in the last position of the field mask for an
               update operation, then new value will be merged into the existing sub-message
               in the target resource.

               For example, given the target message:

                   f {
                     b {
                       d: 1
                       x: 2
                     }
                     c: [1]
                   }

               And an update message:

                   f {
                     b {
                       d: 10
                     }
                     c: [2]
                   }

               then if the field mask is:

                paths: ["f.b", "f.c"]

               then the result will be:

                   f {
                     b {
                       d: 10
                       x: 2
                     }
                     c: [1, 2]
                   }

               An implementation may provide options to override this default behavior for
               repeated and message fields.

               In order to reset a field's value to the default, the field must
               be in the mask and set to the default value in the provided resource.
               Hence, in order to reset all fields of a resource, provide a default
               instance of the resource and set all fields in the mask, or do
               not provide a mask as described below.

               If a field mask is not present on update, the operation applies to
               all fields (as if a field mask of all fields has been specified).
               Note that in the presence of schema evolution, this may mean that
               fields the client does not know and has therefore not filled into
               the request will be reset to their default. If this is unwanted
               behavior, a specific service may require a client to always specify
               a field mask, producing an error if not.

               As with get operations, the location of the resource which
               describes the updated values in the request message depends on the
               operation kind. In any case, the effect of the field mask is
               required to be honored by the API.

               ## Considerations for HTTP REST

               The HTTP kind of an update operation which uses a field mask must
               be set to PATCH instead of PUT in order to satisfy HTTP semantics
               (PUT must only be used for full updates).

               # JSON Encoding of Field Masks

               In JSON, a field mask is encoded as a single string where paths are
               separated by a comma. Fields name in each path are converted
               to/from lower-camel naming conventions.

               As an example, consider the following message declarations:

                   message Profile {
                     User user = 1;
                     Photo photo = 2;
                   }
                   message User {
                     string display_name = 1;
                     string address = 2;
                   }

               In proto a field mask for `Profile` may look as such:

                   mask {
                     paths: "user.display_name"
                     paths: "photo"
                   }

               In JSON, the same mask is represented as below:

                   {
                     mask: "user.displayName,photo"
                   }

               # Field Masks and Oneof Fields

               Field masks treat fields in oneofs just as regular fields. Consider the
               following message:

                   message SampleMessage {
                     oneof test_oneof {
                       string name = 4;
                       SubMessage sub_message = 9;
                     }
                   }

               The field mask can be:

                   mask {
                     paths: "name"
                   }

               Or:

                   mask {
                     paths: "sub_message"
                   }

               Note that oneof type names ("test_oneof" in this case) cannot be used in
               paths.

               ## Field Mask Verification

               The implementation of any API method which has a FieldMask type field in the
               request should verify the included field paths, and return an
               `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error if any path is unmappable.

              `FieldMask` represents a set of symbolic field paths, for example:

                   paths: "f.a"
                   paths: "f.b.d"

               Here `f` represents a field in some root message, `a` and `b`
               fields in the message found in `f`, and `d` a field found in the
               message in `f.b`.

               Field masks are used to specify a subset of fields that should be
               returned by a get operation or modified by an update operation.
               Field masks also have a custom JSON encoding (see below).

               # Field Masks in Projections

               When used in the context of a projection, a response message or
               sub-message is filtered by the API to only contain those fields as
               specified in the mask. For example, if the mask in the previous
               example is applied to a response message as follows:

                   f {
                     a : 22
                     b {
                       d : 1
                       x : 2
                     }
                     y : 13
                   }
                   z: 8

               The result will not contain specific values for fields x,y and z
               (their value will be set to the default, and omitted in proto text
               output):


                   f {
                     a : 22
                     b {
                       d : 1
                     }
                   }

               A repeated field is not allowed except at the last position of a
               paths string.

               If a FieldMask object is not present in a get operation, the
               operation applies to all fields (as if a FieldMask of all fields
               had been specified).

               Note that a field mask does not necessarily apply to the
               top-level response message. In case of a REST get operation, the
               field mask applies directly to the response, but in case of a REST
               list operation, the mask instead applies to each individual message
               in the returned resource list. In case of a REST custom method,
               other definitions may be used. Where the mask applies will be
               clearly documented together with its declaration in the API.  In
               any case, the effect on the returned resource/resources is required
               behavior for APIs.

               # Field Masks in Update Operations

               A field mask in update operations specifies which fields of the
               targeted resource are going to be updated. The API is required
               to only change the values of the fields as specified in the mask
               and leave the others untouched. If a resource is passed in to
               describe the updated values, the API ignores the values of all
               fields not covered by the mask.

               If a repeated field is specified for an update operation, new values will
               be appended to the existing repeated field in the target resource. Note that
               a repeated field is only allowed in the last position of a `paths` string.

               If a sub-message is specified in the last position of the field mask for an
               update operation, then new value will be merged into the existing sub-message
               in the target resource.

               For example, given the target message:

                   f {
                     b {
                       d: 1
                       x: 2
                     }
                     c: [1]
                   }

               And an update message:

                   f {
                     b {
                       d: 10
                     }
                     c: [2]
                   }

               then if the field mask is:

                paths: ["f.b", "f.c"]

               then the result will be:

                   f {
                     b {
                       d: 10
                       x: 2
                     }
                     c: [1, 2]
                   }

               An implementation may provide options to override this default behavior for
               repeated and message fields.

               In order to reset a field's value to the default, the field must
               be in the mask and set to the default value in the provided resource.
               Hence, in order to reset all fields of a resource, provide a default
               instance of the resource and set all fields in the mask, or do
               not provide a mask as described below.

               If a field mask is not present on update, the operation applies to
               all fields (as if a field mask of all fields has been specified).
               Note that in the presence of schema evolution, this may mean that
               fields the client does not know and has therefore not filled into
               the request will be reset to their default. If this is unwanted
               behavior, a specific service may require a client to always specify
               a field mask, producing an error if not.

               As with get operations, the location of the resource which
               describes the updated values in the request message depends on the
               operation kind. In any case, the effect of the field mask is
               required to be honored by the API.

               ## Considerations for HTTP REST

               The HTTP kind of an update operation which uses a field mask must
               be set to PATCH instead of PUT in order to satisfy HTTP semantics
               (PUT must only be used for full updates).

               # JSON Encoding of Field Masks

               In JSON, a field mask is encoded as a single string where paths are
               separated by a comma. Fields name in each path are converted
               to/from lower-camel naming conventions.

               As an example, consider the following message declarations:

                   message Profile {
                     User user = 1;
                     Photo photo = 2;
                   }
                   message User {
                     string display_name = 1;
                     string address = 2;
                   }

               In proto a field mask for `Profile` may look as such:

                   mask {
                     paths: "user.display_name"
                     paths: "photo"
                   }

               In JSON, the same mask is represented as below:

                   {
                     mask: "user.displayName,photo"
                   }

               # Field Masks and Oneof Fields

               Field masks treat fields in oneofs just as regular fields. Consider the
               following message:

                   message SampleMessage {
                     oneof test_oneof {
                       string name = 4;
                       SubMessage sub_message = 9;
                     }
                   }

               The field mask can be:

                   mask {
                     paths: "name"
                   }

               Or:

                   mask {
                     paths: "sub_message"
                   }

               Note that oneof type names ("test_oneof" in this case) cannot be used in
               paths.

               ## Field Mask Verification

               The implementation of any API method which has a FieldMask type field in the
               request should verify the included field paths, and return an
               `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error if any path is unmappable.

              `FieldMask` represents a set of symbolic field paths, for example:

                   paths: "f.a"
                   paths: "f.b.d"

               Here `f` represents a field in some root message, `a` and `b`
               fields in the message found in `f`, and `d` a field found in the
               message in `f.b`.

               Field masks are used to specify a subset of fields that should be
               returned by a get operation or modified by an update operation.
               Field masks also have a custom JSON encoding (see below).

               # Field Masks in Projections

               When used in the context of a projection, a response message or
               sub-message is filtered by the API to only contain those fields as
               specified in the mask. For example, if the mask in the previous
               example is applied to a response message as follows:

                   f {
                     a : 22
                     b {
                       d : 1
                       x : 2
                     }
                     y : 13
                   }
                   z: 8

               The result will not contain specific values for fields x,y and z
               (their value will be set to the default, and omitted in proto text
               output):


                   f {
                     a : 22
                     b {
                       d : 1
                     }
                   }

               A repeated field is not allowed except at the last position of a
               paths string.

               If a FieldMask object is not present in a get operation, the
               operation applies to all fields (as if a FieldMask of all fields
               had been specified).

               Note that a field mask does not necessarily apply to the
               top-level response message. In case of a REST get operation, the
               field mask applies directly to the response, but in case of a REST
               list operation, the mask instead applies to each individual message
               in the returned resource list. In case of a REST custom method,
               other definitions may be used. Where the mask applies will be
               clearly documented together with its declaration in the API.  In
               any case, the effect on the returned resource/resources is required
               behavior for APIs.

               # Field Masks in Update Operations

               A field mask in update operations specifies which fields of the
               targeted resource are going to be updated. The API is required
               to only change the values of the fields as specified in the mask
               and leave the others untouched. If a resource is passed in to
               describe the updated values, the API ignores the values of all
               fields not covered by the mask.

               If a repeated field is specified for an update operation, new values will
               be appended to the existing repeated field in the target resource. Note that
               a repeated field is only allowed in the last position of a `paths` string.

               If a sub-message is specified in the last position of the field mask for an
               update operation, then new value will be merged into the existing sub-message
               in the target resource.

               For example, given the target message:

                   f {
                     b {
                       d: 1
                       x: 2
                     }
                     c: [1]
                   }

               And an update message:

                   f {
                     b {
                       d: 10
                     }
                     c: [2]
                   }

               then if the field mask is:

                paths: ["f.b", "f.c"]

               then the result will be:

                   f {
                     b {
                       d: 10
                       x: 2
                     }
                     c: [1, 2]
                   }

               An implementation may provide options to override this default behavior for
               repeated and message fields.

               In order to reset a field's value to the default, the field must
               be in the mask and set to the default value in the provided resource.
               Hence, in order to reset all fields of a resource, provide a default
               instance of the resource and set all fields in the mask, or do
               not provide a mask as described below.

               If a field mask is not present on update, the operation applies to
               all fields (as if a field mask of all fields has been specified).
               Note that in the presence of schema evolution, this may mean that
               fields the client does not know and has therefore not filled into
               the request will be reset to their default. If this is unwanted
               behavior, a specific service may require a client to always specify
               a field mask, producing an error if not.

               As with get operations, the location of the resource which
               describes the updated values in the request message depends on the
               operation kind. In any case, the effect of the field mask is
               required to be honored by the API.

               ## Considerations for HTTP REST

               The HTTP kind of an update operation which uses a field mask must
               be set to PATCH instead of PUT in order to satisfy HTTP semantics
               (PUT must only be used for full updates).

               # JSON Encoding of Field Masks

               In JSON, a field mask is encoded as a single string where paths are
               separated by a comma. Fields name in each path are converted
               to/from lower-camel naming conventions.

               As an example, consider the following message declarations:

                   message Profile {
                     User user = 1;
                     Photo photo = 2;
                   }
                   message User {
                     string display_name = 1;
                     string address = 2;
                   }

               In proto a field mask for `Profile` may look as such:

                   mask {
                     paths: "user.display_name"
                     paths: "photo"
                   }

               In JSON, the same mask is represented as below:

                   {
                     mask: "user.displayName,photo"
                   }

               # Field Masks and Oneof Fields

               Field masks treat fields in oneofs just as regular fields. Consider the
               following message:

                   message SampleMessage {
                     oneof test_oneof {
                       string name = 4;
                       SubMessage sub_message = 9;
                     }
                   }

               The field mask can be:

                   mask {
                     paths: "name"
                   }

               Or:

                   mask {
                     paths: "sub_message"
                   }

               Note that oneof type names ("test_oneof" in this case) cannot be used in
               paths.

               ## Field Mask Verification

               The implementation of any API method which has a FieldMask type field in the
               request should verify the included field paths, and return an
               `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error if any path is unmappable.

              `FieldMask` represents a set of symbolic field paths, for example:

                   paths: "f.a"
                   paths: "f.b.d"

               Here `f` represents a field in some root message, `a` and `b`
               fields in the message found in `f`, and `d` a field found in the
               message in `f.b`.

               Field masks are used to specify a subset of fields that should be
               returned by a get operation or modified by an update operation.
               Field masks also have a custom JSON encoding (see below).

               # Field Masks in Projections

               When used in the context of a projection, a response message or
               sub-message is filtered by the API to only contain those fields as
               specified in the mask. For example, if the mask in the previous
               example is applied to a response message as follows:

                   f {
                     a : 22
                     b {
                       d : 1
                       x : 2
                     }
                     y : 13
                   }
                   z: 8

               The result will not contain specific values for fields x,y and z
               (their value will be set to the default, and omitted in proto text
               output):


                   f {
                     a : 22
                     b {
                       d : 1
                     }
                   }

               A repeated field is not allowed except at the last position of a
               paths string.

               If a FieldMask object is not present in a get operation, the
               operation applies to all fields (as if a FieldMask of all fields
               had been specified).

               Note that a field mask does not necessarily apply to the
               top-level response message. In case of a REST get operation, the
               field mask applies directly to the response, but in case of a REST
               list operation, the mask instead applies to each individual message
               in the returned resource list. In case of a REST custom method,
               other definitions may be used. Where the mask applies will be
               clearly documented together with its declaration in the API.  In
               any case, the effect on the returned resource/resources is required
               behavior for APIs.

               # Field Masks in Update Operations

               A field mask in update operations specifies which fields of the
               targeted resource are going to be updated. The API is required
               to only change the values of the fields as specified in the mask
               and leave the others untouched. If a resource is passed in to
               describe the updated values, the API ignores the values of all
               fields not covered by the mask.

               If a repeated field is specified for an update operation, new values will
               be appended to the existing repeated field in the target resource. Note that
               a repeated field is only allowed in the last position of a `paths` string.

               If a sub-message is specified in the last position of the field mask for an
               update operation, then new value will be merged into the existing sub-message
               in the target resource.

               For example, given the target message:

                   f {
                     b {
                       d: 1
                       x: 2
                     }
                     c: [1]
                   }

               And an update message:

                   f {
                     b {
                       d: 10
                     }
                     c: [2]
                   }

               then if the field mask is:

                paths: ["f.b", "f.c"]

               then the result will be:

                   f {
                     b {
                       d: 10
                       x: 2
                     }
                     c: [1, 2]
                   }

               An implementation may provide options to override this default behavior for
               repeated and message fields.

               In order to reset a field's value to the default, the field must
               be in the mask and set to the default value in the provided resource.
               Hence, in order to reset all fields of a resource, provide a default
               instance of the resource and set all fields in the mask, or do
               not provide a mask as described below.

               If a field mask is not present on update, the operation applies to
               all fields (as if a field mask of all fields has been specified).
               Note that in the presence of schema evolution, this may mean that
               fields the client does not know and has therefore not filled into
               the request will be reset to their default. If this is unwanted
               behavior, a specific service may require a client to always specify
               a field mask, producing an error if not.

               As with get operations, the location of the resource which
               describes the updated values in the request message depends on the
               operation kind. In any case, the effect of the field mask is
               required to be honored by the API.

               ## Considerations for HTTP REST

               The HTTP kind of an update operation which uses a field mask must
               be set to PATCH instead of PUT in order to satisfy HTTP semantics
               (PUT must only be used for full updates).

               # JSON Encoding of Field Masks

               In JSON, a field mask is encoded as a single string where paths are
               separated by a comma. Fields name in each path are converted
               to/from lower-camel naming conventions.

               As an example, consider the following message declarations:

                   message Profile {
                     User user = 1;
                     Photo photo = 2;
                   }
                   message User {
                     string display_name = 1;
                     string address = 2;
                   }

               In proto a field mask for `Profile` may look as such:

                   mask {
                     paths: "user.display_name"
                     paths: "photo"
                   }

               In JSON, the same mask is represented as below:

                   {
                     mask: "user.displayName,photo"
                   }

               # Field Masks and Oneof Fields

               Field masks treat fields in oneofs just as regular fields. Consider the
               following message:

                   message SampleMessage {
                     oneof test_oneof {
                       string name = 4;
                       SubMessage sub_message = 9;
                     }
                   }

               The field mask can be:

                   mask {
                     paths: "name"
                   }

               Or:

                   mask {
                     paths: "sub_message"
                   }

               Note that oneof type names ("test_oneof" in this case) cannot be used in
               paths.

               ## Field Mask Verification

               The implementation of any API method which has a FieldMask type field in the
               request should verify the included field paths, and return an
               `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error if any path is unmappable.

              `FieldMask` represents a set of symbolic field paths, for example:

                   paths: "f.a"
                   paths: "f.b.d"

               Here `f` represents a field in some root message, `a` and `b`
               fields in the message found in `f`, and `d` a field found in the
               message in `f.b`.

               Field masks are used to specify a subset of fields that should be
               returned by a get operation or modified by an update operation.
               Field masks also have a custom JSON encoding (see below).

               # Field Masks in Projections

               When used in the context of a projection, a response message or
               sub-message is filtered by the API to only contain those fields as
               specified in the mask. For example, if the mask in the previous
               example is applied to a response message as follows:

                   f {
                     a : 22
                     b {
                       d : 1
                       x : 2
                     }
                     y : 13
                   }
                   z: 8

               The result will not contain specific values for fields x,y and z
               (their value will be set to the default, and omitted in proto text
               output):


                   f {
                     a : 22
                     b {
                       d : 1
                     }
                   }

               A repeated field is not allowed except at the last position of a
               paths string.

               If a FieldMask object is not present in a get operation, the
               operation applies to all fields (as if a FieldMask of all fields
               had been specified).

               Note that a field mask does not necessarily apply to the
               top-level response message. In case of a REST get operation, the
               field mask applies directly to the response, but in case of a REST
               list operation, the mask instead applies to each individual message
               in the returned resource list. In case of a REST custom method,
               other definitions may be used. Where the mask applies will be
               clearly documented together with its declaration in the API.  In
               any case, the effect on the returned resource/resources is required
               behavior for APIs.

               # Field Masks in Update Operations

               A field mask in update operations specifies which fields of the
               targeted resource are going to be updated. The API is required
               to only change the values of the fields as specified in the mask
               and leave the others untouched. If a resource is passed in to
               describe the updated values, the API ignores the values of all
               fields not covered by the mask.

               If a repeated field is specified for an update operation, new values will
               be appended to the existing repeated field in the target resource. Note that
               a repeated field is only allowed in the last position of a `paths` string.

               If a sub-message is specified in the last position of the field mask for an
               update operation, then new value will be merged into the existing sub-message
               in the target resource.

               For example, given the target message:

                   f {
                     b {
                       d: 1
                       x: 2
                     }
                     c: [1]
                   }

               And an update message:

                   f {
                     b {
                       d: 10
                     }
                     c: [2]
                   }

               then if the field mask is:

                paths: ["f.b", "f.c"]

               then the result will be:

                   f {
                     b {
                       d: 10
                       x: 2
                     }
                     c: [1, 2]
                   }

               An implementation may provide options to override this default behavior for
               repeated and message fields.

               In order to reset a field's value to the default, the field must
               be in the mask and set to the default value in the provided resource.
               Hence, in order to reset all fields of a resource, provide a default
               instance of the resource and set all fields in the mask, or do
               not provide a mask as described below.

               If a field mask is not present on update, the operation applies to
               all fields (as if a field mask of all fields has been specified).
               Note that in the presence of schema evolution, this may mean that
               fields the client does not know and has therefore not filled into
               the request will be reset to their default. If this is unwanted
               behavior, a specific service may require a client to always specify
               a field mask, producing an error if not.

               As with get operations, the location of the resource which
               describes the updated values in the request message depends on the
               operation kind. In any case, the effect of the field mask is
               required to be honored by the API.

               ## Considerations for HTTP REST

               The HTTP kind of an update operation which uses a field mask must
               be set to PATCH instead of PUT in order to satisfy HTTP semantics
               (PUT must only be used for full updates).

               # JSON Encoding of Field Masks

               In JSON, a field mask is encoded as a single string where paths are
               separated by a comma. Fields name in each path are converted
               to/from lower-camel naming conventions.

               As an example, consider the following message declarations:

                   message Profile {
                     User user = 1;
                     Photo photo = 2;
                   }
                   message User {
                     string display_name = 1;
                     string address = 2;
                   }

               In proto a field mask for `Profile` may look as such:

                   mask {
                     paths: "user.display_name"
                     paths: "photo"
                   }

               In JSON, the same mask is represented as below:

                   {
                     mask: "user.displayName,photo"
                   }

               # Field Masks and Oneof Fields

               Field masks treat fields in oneofs just as regular fields. Consider the
               following message:

                   message SampleMessage {
                     oneof test_oneof {
                       string name = 4;
                       SubMessage sub_message = 9;
                     }
                   }

               The field mask can be:

                   mask {
                     paths: "name"
                   }

               Or:

                   mask {
                     paths: "sub_message"
                   }

               Note that oneof type names ("test_oneof" in this case) cannot be used in
               paths.

               ## Field Mask Verification

               The implementation of any API method which has a FieldMask type field in the
               request should verify the included field paths, and return an
               `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error if any path is unmappable.

              `FieldMask` represents a set of symbolic field paths, for example:

                   paths: "f.a"
                   paths: "f.b.d"

               Here `f` represents a field in some root message, `a` and `b`
               fields in the message found in `f`, and `d` a field found in the
               message in `f.b`.

               Field masks are used to specify a subset of fields that should be
               returned by a get operation or modified by an update operation.
               Field masks also have a custom JSON encoding (see below).

               # Field Masks in Projections

               When used in the context of a projection, a response message or
               sub-message is filtered by the API to only contain those fields as
               specified in the mask. For example, if the mask in the previous
               example is applied to a response message as follows:

                   f {
                     a : 22
                     b {
                       d : 1
                       x : 2
                     }
                     y : 13
                   }
                   z: 8

               The result will not contain specific values for fields x,y and z
               (their value will be set to the default, and omitted in proto text
               output):


                   f {
                     a : 22
                     b {
                       d : 1
                     }
                   }

               A repeated field is not allowed except at the last position of a
               paths string.

               If a FieldMask object is not present in a get operation, the
               operation applies to all fields (as if a FieldMask of all fields
               had been specified).

               Note that a field mask does not necessarily apply to the
               top-level response message. In case of a REST get operation, the
               field mask applies directly to the response, but in case of a REST
               list operation, the mask instead applies to each individual message
               in the returned resource list. In case of a REST custom method,
               other definitions may be used. Where the mask applies will be
               clearly documented together with its declaration in the API.  In
               any case, the effect on the returned resource/resources is required
               behavior for APIs.

               # Field Masks in Update Operations

               A field mask in update operations specifies which fields of the
               targeted resource are going to be updated. The API is required
               to only change the values of the fields as specified in the mask
               and leave the others untouched. If a resource is passed in to
               describe the updated values, the API ignores the values of all
               fields not covered by the mask.

               If a repeated field is specified for an update operation, new values will
               be appended to the existing repeated field in the target resource. Note that
               a repeated field is only allowed in the last position of a `paths` string.

               If a sub-message is specified in the last position of the field mask for an
               update operation, then new value will be merged into the existing sub-message
               in the target resource.

               For example, given the target message:

                   f {
                     b {
                       d: 1
                       x: 2
                     }
                     c: [1]
                   }

               And an update message:

                   f {
                     b {
                       d: 10
                     }
                     c: [2]
                   }

               then if the field mask is:

                paths: ["f.b", "f.c"]

               then the result will be:

                   f {
                     b {
                       d: 10
                       x: 2
                     }
                     c: [1, 2]
                   }

               An implementation may provide options to override this default behavior for
               repeated and message fields.

               In order to reset a field's value to the default, the field must
               be in the mask and set to the default value in the provided resource.
               Hence, in order to reset all fields of a resource, provide a default
               instance of the resource and set all fields in the mask, or do
               not provide a mask as described below.

               If a field mask is not present on update, the operation applies to
               all fields (as if a field mask of all fields has been specified).
               Note that in the presence of schema evolution, this may mean that
               fields the client does not know and has therefore not filled into
               the request will be reset to their default. If this is unwanted
               behavior, a specific service may require a client to always specify
               a field mask, producing an error if not.

               As with get operations, the location of the resource which
               describes the updated values in the request message depends on the
               operation kind. In any case, the effect of the field mask is
               required to be honored by the API.

               ## Considerations for HTTP REST

               The HTTP kind of an update operation which uses a field mask must
               be set to PATCH instead of PUT in order to satisfy HTTP semantics
               (PUT must only be used for full updates).

               # JSON Encoding of Field Masks

               In JSON, a field mask is encoded as a single string where paths are
               separated by a comma. Fields name in each path are converted
               to/from lower-camel naming conventions.

               As an example, consider the following message declarations:

                   message Profile {
                     User user = 1;
                     Photo photo = 2;
                   }
                   message User {
                     string display_name = 1;
                     string address = 2;
                   }

               In proto a field mask for `Profile` may look as such:

                   mask {
                     paths: "user.display_name"
                     paths: "photo"
                   }

               In JSON, the same mask is represented as below:

                   {
                     mask: "user.displayName,photo"
                   }

               # Field Masks and Oneof Fields

               Field masks treat fields in oneofs just as regular fields. Consider the
               following message:

                   message SampleMessage {
                     oneof test_oneof {
                       string name = 4;
                       SubMessage sub_message = 9;
                     }
                   }

               The field mask can be:

                   mask {
                     paths: "name"
                   }

               Or:

                   mask {
                     paths: "sub_message"
                   }

               Note that oneof type names ("test_oneof" in this case) cannot be used in
               paths.

               ## Field Mask Verification

               The implementation of any API method which has a FieldMask type field in the
               request should verify the included field paths, and return an
               `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error if any path is unmappable.

              `FieldMask` represents a set of symbolic field paths, for example:

                   paths: "f.a"
                   paths: "f.b.d"

               Here `f` represents a field in some root message, `a` and `b`
               fields in the message found in `f`, and `d` a field found in the
               message in `f.b`.

               Field masks are used to specify a subset of fields that should be
               returned by a get operation or modified by an update operation.
               Field masks also have a custom JSON encoding (see below).

               # Field Masks in Projections

               When used in the context of a projection, a response message or
               sub-message is filtered by the API to only contain those fields as
               specified in the mask. For example, if the mask in the previous
               example is applied to a response message as follows:

                   f {
                     a : 22
                     b {
                       d : 1
                       x : 2
                     }
                     y : 13
                   }
                   z: 8

               The result will not contain specific values for fields x,y and z
               (their value will be set to the default, and omitted in proto text
               output):


                   f {
                     a : 22
                     b {
                       d : 1
                     }
                   }

               A repeated field is not allowed except at the last position of a
               paths string.

               If a FieldMask object is not present in a get operation, the
               operation applies to all fields (as if a FieldMask of all fields
               had been specified).

               Note that a field mask does not necessarily apply to the
               top-level response message. In case of a REST get operation, the
               field mask applies directly to the response, but in case of a REST
               list operation, the mask instead applies to each individual message
               in the returned resource list. In case of a REST custom method,
               other definitions may be used. Where the mask applies will be
               clearly documented together with its declaration in the API.  In
               any case, the effect on the returned resource/resources is required
               behavior for APIs.

               # Field Masks in Update Operations

               A field mask in update operations specifies which fields of the
               targeted resource are going to be updated. The API is required
               to only change the values of the fields as specified in the mask
               and leave the others untouched. If a resource is passed in to
               describe the updated values, the API ignores the values of all
               fields not covered by the mask.

               If a repeated field is specified for an update operation, new values will
               be appended to the existing repeated field in the target resource. Note that
               a repeated field is only allowed in the last position of a `paths` string.

               If a sub-message is specified in the last position of the field mask for an
               update operation, then new value will be merged into the existing sub-message
               in the target resource.

               For example, given the target message:

                   f {
                     b {
                       d: 1
                       x: 2
                     }
                     c: [1]
                   }

               And an update message:

                   f {
                     b {
                       d: 10
                     }
                     c: [2]
                   }

               then if the field mask is:

                paths: ["f.b", "f.c"]

               then the result will be:

                   f {
                     b {
                       d: 10
                       x: 2
                     }
                     c: [1, 2]
                   }

               An implementation may provide options to override this default behavior for
               repeated and message fields.

               In order to reset a field's value to the default, the field must
               be in the mask and set to the default value in the provided resource.
               Hence, in order to reset all fields of a resource, provide a default
               instance of the resource and set all fields in the mask, or do
               not provide a mask as described below.

               If a field mask is not present on update, the operation applies to
               all fields (as if a field mask of all fields has been specified).
               Note that in the presence of schema evolution, this may mean that
               fields the client does not know and has therefore not filled into
               the request will be reset to their default. If this is unwanted
               behavior, a specific service may require a client to always specify
               a field mask, producing an error if not.

               As with get operations, the location of the resource which
               describes the updated values in the request message depends on the
               operation kind. In any case, the effect of the field mask is
               required to be honored by the API.

               ## Considerations for HTTP REST

               The HTTP kind of an update operation which uses a field mask must
               be set to PATCH instead of PUT in order to satisfy HTTP semantics
               (PUT must only be used for full updates).

               # JSON Encoding of Field Masks

               In JSON, a field mask is encoded as a single string where paths are
               separated by a comma. Fields name in each path are converted
               to/from lower-camel naming conventions.

               As an example, consider the following message declarations:

                   message Profile {
                     User user = 1;
                     Photo photo = 2;
                   }
                   message User {
                     string display_name = 1;
                     string address = 2;
                   }

               In proto a field mask for `Profile` may look as such:

                   mask {
                     paths: "user.display_name"
                     paths: "photo"
                   }

               In JSON, the same mask is represented as below:

                   {
                     mask: "user.displayName,photo"
                   }

               # Field Masks and Oneof Fields

               Field masks treat fields in oneofs just as regular fields. Consider the
               following message:

                   message SampleMessage {
                     oneof test_oneof {
                       string name = 4;
                       SubMessage sub_message = 9;
                     }
                   }

               The field mask can be:

                   mask {
                     paths: "name"
                   }

               Or:

                   mask {
                     paths: "sub_message"
                   }

               Note that oneof type names ("test_oneof" in this case) cannot be used in
               paths.

               ## Field Mask Verification

               The implementation of any API method which has a FieldMask type field in the
               request should verify the included field paths, and return an
               `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error if any path is unmappable.

         targeted resource are going to be updated. The API is required
         to only change the values of the fields as specified in the mask

         describe the updated values, the API ignores the values of all
         fields not covered by the mask.

         If a repeated field is specified for an update operation, new values will

         a repeated field is only allowed in the last position of a `paths` string.

               c: [1]
             }

         And an update message:

             f {
               b {
                 d: 10
               }
               c: [2]
             }

         then if the field mask is:

          paths: ["f.b", "f.c"]

         then the result will be:

             f {
               b {
                 d: 10
                 x: 2
               }
               c: [1, 2]
             }

         An implementation may provide options to override this default behavior for
         repeated and message fields.

         In order to reset a field's value to the default, the field must
         be in the mask and set to the default value in the provided resource.
         Hence, in order to reset all fields of a resource, provide a default
         instance of the resource and set all fields in the mask, or do
         not provide a mask as described below.

         If a field mask is not present on update, the operation applies to
         all fields (as if a field mask of all fields has been specified).
         Note that in the presence of schema evolution, this may mean that
         fields the client does not know and has therefore not filled into
         the request will be reset to their default. If this is unwanted
         behavior, a specific service may require a client to always specify
         a field mask, producing an error if not.

         As with get operations, the location of the resource which
         describes the updated values in the request message depends on the
         operation kind. In any case, the effect of the field mask is
         required to be honored by the API.

         ## Considerations for HTTP REST

         The HTTP kind of an update operation which uses a field mask must
         be set to PATCH instead of PUT in order to satisfy HTTP semantics
         (PUT must only be used for full updates).

         # JSON Encoding of Field Masks

         In JSON, a field mask is encoded as a single string where paths are
         separated by a comma. Fields name in each path are converted
         to/from lower-camel naming conventions.

         As an example, consider the following message declarations:

             message Profile {
               User user = 1;
               Photo photo = 2;
             }
             message User {
               string display_name = 1;
               string address = 2;
             }

         In proto a field mask for `Profile` may look as such:

             mask {
               paths: "user.display_name"
               paths: "photo"
             }

         In JSON, the same mask is represented as below:

             {
               mask: "user.displayName,photo"
             }

         # Field Masks and Oneof Fields

         Field masks treat fields in oneofs just as regular fields. Consider the
         following message:

             message SampleMessage {
               oneof test_oneof {
                 string name = 4;
                 SubMessage sub_message = 9;
               }
             }

         The field mask can be:

             mask {
               paths: "name"
             }

         Or:

             mask {
               paths: "sub_message"
             }

         Note that oneof type names ("test_oneof" in this case) cannot be used in
         paths.

         ## Field Mask Verification

         The implementation of any API method which has a FieldMask type field in the
         request should verify the included field paths, and return an
         `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error if any path is unmappable.

      description: |-
        A Timestamp represents a point in time independent of any time zone or local
         calendar, encoded as a count of seconds and fractions of seconds at
         nanosecond resolution. The count is relative to an epoch at UTC midnight on
         January 1, 1970, in the proleptic Gregorian calendar which extends the
         Gregorian calendar backwards to year one.

         All minutes are 60 seconds long. Leap seconds are "smeared" so that no leap
         second table is needed for interpretation, using a [24-hour linear
         smear](https://developers.google.com/time/smear).

         The range is from 0001-01-01T00:00:00Z to 9999-12-31T23:59:59.999999999Z. By
         restricting to that range, we ensure that we can convert to and from [RFC
         3339](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt) date strings.

         # Examples

         Example 1: Compute Timestamp from POSIX `time()`.

             Timestamp timestamp;
             timestamp.set_seconds(time(NULL));
             timestamp.set_nanos(0);

         Example 2: Compute Timestamp from POSIX `gettimeofday()`.

             struct timeval tv;
             gettimeofday(&tv, NULL);

             Timestamp timestamp;
             timestamp.set_seconds(tv.tv_sec);
             timestamp.set_nanos(tv.tv_usec * 1000);

         Example 3: Compute Timestamp from Win32 `GetSystemTimeAsFileTime()`.

             FILETIME ft;
             GetSystemTimeAsFileTime(&ft);
             UINT64 ticks = (((UINT64)ft.dwHighDateTime) << 32) | ft.dwLowDateTime;

             // A Windows tick is 100 nanoseconds. Windows epoch 1601-01-01T00:00:00Z
             // is 11644473600 seconds before Unix epoch 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.
             Timestamp timestamp;
             timestamp.set_seconds((INT64) ((ticks / 10000000) - 11644473600LL));
             timestamp.set_nanos((INT32) ((ticks % 10000000) * 100));

         Example 4: Compute Timestamp from Java `System.currentTimeMillis()`.

             long millis = System.currentTimeMillis();

             Timestamp timestamp = Timestamp.newBuilder().setSeconds(millis / 1000)
                 .setNanos((int) ((millis % 1000) * 1000000)).build();

         Example 5: Compute Timestamp from Java `Instant.now()`.

             Instant now = Instant.now();

             Timestamp timestamp =
                 Timestamp.newBuilder().setSeconds(now.getEpochSecond())
                     .setNanos(now.getNano()).build();

         Example 6: Compute Timestamp from current time in Python.

             timestamp = Timestamp()
             timestamp.GetCurrentTime()

         # JSON Mapping

         In JSON format, the Timestamp type is encoded as a string in the
         [RFC 3339](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt) format. That is, the
         format is "{year}-{month}-{day}T{hour}:{min}:{sec}[.{frac_sec}]Z"
         where {year} is always expressed using four digits while {month}, {day},
         {hour}, {min}, and {sec} are zero-padded to two digits each. The fractional
         seconds, which can go up to 9 digits (i.e. up to 1 nanosecond resolution),
         are optional. The "Z" suffix indicates the timezone ("UTC"); the timezone
         is required. A proto3 JSON serializer should always use UTC (as indicated by
         "Z") when printing the Timestamp type and a proto3 JSON parser should be
         able to accept both UTC and other timezones (as indicated by an offset).

         For example, "2017-01-15T01:30:15.01Z" encodes 15.01 seconds past
         01:30 UTC on January 15, 2017.

         In JavaScript, one can convert a Date object to this format using the
         standard
         [toISOString()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toISOString)
         method. In Python, a standard `datetime.datetime` object can be converted
         to this format using
         [`strftime`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/time.html#time.strftime) with
         the time format spec '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ'. Likewise, in Java, one can use
         the Joda Time's [`ISODateTimeFormat.dateTime()`](
         http://joda-time.sourceforge.net/apidocs/org/joda/time/format/ISODateTimeFormat.html#dateTime()
         ) to obtain a formatter capable of generating timestamps in this format.
